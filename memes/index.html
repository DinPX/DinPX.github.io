Projecting what they want to see to us is simply far more alluring and stimulating. One cannot be truly vulnerable to anyone.</p><p>This is a cry for help for what connects us in a personal level which is getting less by less each day. The cycle must be stopped and you should wake up. Be yourself to save a person. Leave the society. Love your homies and pookies.</p><p>Mental health is no joke and you're not defined by mere numbers. In the end, you're you, and so are they.</p><p>We're utterly flawed humans.</p>">

The thing is that not everyone is willing to understand even if they listen.</p><p>Anyone can lend their ears, but nothing of sharing the same struggles nor feeling the pain. We're afraid of getting hurt, and we had plenty on our plate already.</p><p>Still, one can just be there for a person. No words are needed.</p>">

Without rest we only make fools of ourselves in face of challenges for not giving it all.</p><p>There are just times where we can't just continue anything at all, that our bodies and minds are not in it, even souls can be crushed, and so only with enough time and reflection we can get back up again in full strength.</p><p>There's no shame in letting go and being vulnerable in a moment to take a break from everything. We're not machines.</p><p>We're utterly fragile humans.</p>">

There's only much one can do as a human, and we hit our limits from time to time. Things just don't work at certain circumstances.</p><p>We are slaves of no one, not even death. Not with our past, not with our mistakes, and not even with ourselves.</p><p>Learn to forgive and love yourself. Take each step slowly, and face tomorrow with a bit of hope. Life is just starting, and you can throw that spider to despair.</p>">

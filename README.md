It is a hobby project as well as a personal site for my creations and thoughts, which aesthetics and functionalities are not only inspired by the modern time but also (a bit heavily) by the early 2000s.

As the webpage is inspired by the old web, it has a music player, a pet sim and Tamagotchi-inspired pet, a more personalized theme, and buttons and graphics alike which are commonly used back then.

## Features
- Animations can be turned off with `prefers-reduced-motion`
    - Helpful for visitors who want/need less motions
- Theme options (on the top right corner of the banner)
- Chat box powered by [Chattable by xobyte](https://iframe.chat/).
- Tooltips on hovered items by [xobyte](https://andrew-grider.com/).
- Pet sim game powered by [GifyPet by MelonKing](https://gifypet.neocities.org/).
- Tamagotchi-inspired pet powered by [tamaNOTchi!](https://tamanotchi.world/).
- Mobile layout (still in need for more adjustments to UI)
- RSS feed for blogs and other updates
- My personal music playlist (as of Q4 2024)

## Copyright
### Featured Art, Pixel Art, etc.
I own and have the rights to all the pixel art (art, artworks, fanarts, illustrations) in all pages, unless otherwise stated, especially the pieces under Gallery and Commissions pages.

I do not allow any form of training or selling them in any way or form (e.g. Gen AI, NFTs, crypto, Ko-fi, itch.io, and alike).

### Website Buttons and Other Graphics
The buttons, which most are 88x31 in size, are owned by their respective authors, and are under permission to be used in means of sharing their websites. The same applies to other graphics that are not specifically owned by anyone, e.g. a cropped screenshot from an anime episode, sticker GIFs, etc.

### Music
All music/audio used in the music player belongs to their respective authors.

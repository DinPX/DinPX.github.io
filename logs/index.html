    <p>Body temperature's going down whilst the pain persists. I managed to get my adrenaline rise and going to ease it. Also, there's much less blood which I spat this morning.</p>
    <p>Given that, I finished my daily review and uninstalled Mimo. Let's just say that I found a better alternative for it. And speaking of review, last night I just made it to the Amethyst league in Duolingo, which made me a bit happy. As for the lessons, it currently prompts me to do more writing lessons before proceeding.</p>
    <p>I haven't wrote the characters yet in a repetitive practice manner, aside from few sentence examples here and there. Luckily (or not) I've been <em>'stuck'</em> with few Japanese servers and players from my recent game matches, which was great as I get to read few characters (but in terms of ping we don't talk about that one). I recognize some of the hiragana characters like つ, ん, え, わ, く with certainty, while I still mix other characters like き and さ (good lord, look at their evil presence).</p>
    <p>Aside from this gaming method, I also listened to some JP VTubers and family vlogs in the background whenever I have drained my energy to listen on some playlists. Some words were recognizable while others weren't. It's either I haven't learned or heard them before, may it be thru Duolingo or other means, or that they were talking <strong>too fast</strong>.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="date">March 21, 2025</p>
    <p>My body is burning. Not with passion or anything that would fire me up to finish a task. I've been sick for 3 days now. The immense pain every morning I have to endure just to get up from the bed is distributed from my back and waist. Headache doesn't help either. The coagulated blood on my lungs. Everything is a pain.</p>
    <p>Well, it's not as if I'm on the deathbed, I can manage. I'm used to the pain and I've been on a similar situation back in 2020 in which I got hospitalized. Right now I just find it obnoxious considering the things I need to do. I can't get out, I can't eat properly, and obviously, I need to be careful everytime I'm changing my position or location around the house. It's vexatious.</p>
    <p>Last night it just hit me regarding what caused the back pain in the first place. Remember from one of my log entries where I mentioned us destroying the bed frame to replace with a new one? The entire idiot I am for using too much force when sawing it in half put much strain in the later days, which resulted now in a worse state. I suck.</p>
    <p>I'll just take my fair share of rests until this body of mine completely recovers.</p>
    <p>Moving on, I just did my daily lessons especially Duolingo. I'm getting used on the grammars so far while as for writing not so much. Math and coding is easy as usual since I'm still at units akin to introductions. I haven't wrote anything to my binder notebook.</p>
    <p>For the rest of the day, after <em>'bulking'</em> sweets and beverages, I slept as my head can't keep up with the pain. Moving onto the bed, getting out from it, either way felt like hell. Gritting it every time isn't new.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="date">March 18, 2025</p>
    <p>I found my medals from junior and senior high. It was unexpected for I was just trying to find a working black pen. I know that I still have them, but I completely forgot where they were even stored here.</p>
    <p>The ones from senior high is just one push away before being put in a garbage bin. They're in a rather inconspicuous container that if not checked, anyone would mistake it as garbage. I quickly got rid of the container which holds the boxes and placed them with the ones I got in junior high.</p>
    <p>Then I got my 3 black pens.</p>
    <p>I started my usual review with math, language, and a bit of coding this day. As for taking notes, I only wrote some for Japanese units I completed. As expected, my writing was shaky. Anything barely changed from what my usual handwriting looked like. It's more like my handwriting vexingly varies from the kind of pen and ink they offer. There are times that my writing's cute, other ones were <em>'formal'</em> looking, and the others that are just plainly rushed from their looks. Just as with art, even with my hobbies and interests, my handwriting is a victim for inconsistency.</p>
    <p>I just spent half the day for studying, while the rest for breaks and games. My PS4 and Warframe remains untouched. Genshin's banners are the entire circus. Subscription models are a scam.</p>
    <p>Cookie Run is such a fun game.</p>
    <p>Moving on, this day for some reason my talks with my sib came to be about raising kids in the future. Like how parents should encourage their kids to think and be curious whenever they have questions with the nature instead of raising their voice towards them, etc. (definitely not due to our experiences as children lol). It's a stupid talk for me but it could be meaningful for them. I don't really want to have kids anytime considering not only my character as a human being and individual, but also due to my experiences as well as the current state of the world. It's just not viable in my country if one cannot secure stable finances. Insurances are shit here. Every term is ruled by an alligator. But, yeah, just thinking about the adults not giving a fuck what would happen to the next generations based from their poor decisions infuriates me (not that I'm in the place to talk as I'm quite irresponsible).</p>
    <p>Regardless, it's a quite productive day. A bit stressed with the usual waist and back pain, plus the coagulated blood I had to spit every morning, but I worked on things nonetheless. Also a good day without any socmed dependency thingy.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="date">March 17, 2025</p>
    <p>I'm keeping up with my Duolingo, Khan Academy, and mimo learning journey.</p>
    <p>A 13 day streak is currently recorded on my Duolingo account. It was 3 years since my last activity, and then I came back to it and started the units on learning the Japanese language and writing. Most XP from my accumulated 17,626 meant nothing at all as previously I never really took it seriously during the Russian lessons. It was more like a foolish endeavor of sorts to have something to brag about. Right now, no, ever since I started again on taking notes with the subjects I used to love, and the things I want to know about, I came to love educating myself again <em>on my own way</em>.</p>
    <p>I really felt dumb over the years despite of the projects and few works I've done with ever since dropping out of college. Regardless of traumatic experiences, cooping up myself to the point I didn't even bothered to enrich my brain and not just let it rot. I basically killed the remaining small intellect I have by consuming countless meaningless brainrot content. Sure, those vids made me happy, but in exchange it turned me into an incompetent human being that is replacable by any bot, and I utterly despise that notion. The idea that I haven't improved myself given all the time infuriates me. I became someone whose existence and character I find an atrocity to life itself. I hate being weak and useless. While there are flaws that are acceptable, as we're merely humans in the end, there are ones that draws the line.</p>
    <p>There's nothing wrong in being weak, staying as one is the problem. I won't forgive myself if I don't push my limits in education.</p>
    <p>Anyways, back to the Duolingo stuff, of course I'm starting with the basics. Believe me when I tell you that I'm taking it slowly, unlike then. My #1 Emerald ranking just happened to be there in response to my <em>flawless</em> progress due to the <em>Super</em>'s unli HP. I won't deny that the competitive aspect brings heat and passion to this effort, but I'm not letting myself get distracted from my intended usage of the app, i.e. to focus on learning Japanese.</p>
    <p>Now for my process of reviewing Japanese terms and grammatical structure, I'm not focusing yet on the writing portion, rather I'm taking my time on <strong>listening</strong> and <strong>observing</strong> the sentences. Just as how we used to be children who grew up in an environment, and that environment itself provides what the brain needs (conversation of our parents or cousins for instance) to <strong>record</strong> and <strong>process</strong> daily which will be easier to understand as we grow up, I'm using the same method of listening first on conversations, may it be thru vids or the app, just so I can get used to it. Of course there were some parts of the units which I have to take some writing practice, and I did them as they were required.</p>
    <p>I fucked a ton and figured it out--the internet itself is an entire resource. Just be careful on getting what information to digest and verify their validity, and you're good to go. I also downloaded other apps and resources to use with altogether with Duolingo. They primarily tackles writing, and so it will take sometime before I get to use them fully.</p>
    <p>As for Khan Academy I only grabbed the math courses they have for the time being. Starting with <em>Arithmetic</em> to make the unit and learning progression <em>"feel right"</em>, as well as to refresh my mind, like a warmup before the calamity. Next is Algebra 1 and 2. Some geometry and measurement lessons. Stats and probability. Trigonometry. And lastly even geometry. If I don't tackle these first, as admitedly I can't really recall most of them unless I'm given with exercises and alike, I most likely would fail most intermediate courses they have. Overall after these I'll move on to math subjects again like linear algebra, pre-calc, differential and integral calculus.</p>
    <p>We doing it step by step. Slow but meaningful progress.</p>
    <p>Oh yeah one thing about Khan Academy is that I already used it too long before I discontinued my studies. Still, I'm using a new account to handle my courses and units properly this time. Also, just like with Duolingo, I'm not letting my streaks break--it keeps my brain on track with the lessons and being attentive to them.</p>
    <p>As for mimo, it's just like Duolingo but a chimera that's paired with W3Schools or SoloLearn--good for beginner and experienced coders. I want to be <em>"properly educated"</em> with the terms and alike as while I'm already have experiences with programming, it's not like I know the formal terms everyone uses like with their documentations or tutorials. I do know how to read documentations and references, but being ignorant on these <em>tiny details</em> felt wrong to me, and so I want to familiarize myself to them.</p>
    <p>Right now I only have the <em>Full Stack Dev</em> course to complete on mimo--just like with other lessons, I want to <em>"start from scratch"</em> or else it would feel wrong to me.</p>
    <p>As for the schedule for these 3 apps, I have no such thing. I base them on some random rotation and just review whenever I feel like to or have the energy to go. After that I switch to chores, coding, and some art.</p>
    <p>The cycle repeats to nourish myself, which if even some will find mundane and uninteresting, I see some meaning and hope behind them. Also I really need to prepare my brain for uni lmfao (laugh my fat ass out).</p>
    <br>
    <p class="date">March 15, 2025</p>
    <p>We decluttered tons of unused stuff in our room. It's been there for years and we don't have any means to get rid off them previously, which unlike now we do have some options which prompted us to start working on it. Also we <em>demolished</em> the bed frame as we're going to buy a new one.</p>
    <p>The good thing is that with decluttering, I have a good storage for my favorite books. Therefore there's no need to worry about them during the cleaning. All unused parts and stuff were moved to one of our <em>remote storage</em> rooms--currently we have 3 separate lands here, which are relatively small in sizes.</p>
    <p>Anyways, it's a lot of work but good thing in the end, i.e. I burned a lot of calories despite the usual waist pain in days, I organized my important documents properly, more spaces were made, and others. Being productive with adequate rests really do help the brain to keep going and stay healthy.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="date">March ?, 2025</p>
    <p>Nothing much. The most activities I did today are just a warmup and few HIIT workouts.</p>
    <p>While I stayed pretty much dormant in intensive activities, I'm kinda happy and found it a bit funny to still have few strength to pull these off. Weights weren't used and instead I only focused on utilizing the body parts only (as what used to be part of my routine back then).</p>
    <p>Looking at the mirror, I know that I'll never get any taller. I'll remain a <em>smol</em> gremlin fuck for the rest of my days.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="date">March 7, 2025</p>
    <p>Since I'm slow on things, and that my brain is basically zombiefied due to doomscrolling, it took a while for me to realize that while on the small journey from the previous log, I was once a bit familiar of the place, and that I more than once roamed those places. Hopeless and meaningless endeavours that is. Worthless reason. Nothing but pursuit of false avarice. I wasn't thinking straight at the time. Nonetheless, without the stupid decisions in history I wouldn't be able to navigate the places much easier at this point. Insane to think that you can really learn from mistakes, if done right.</p>
    <p>Anyways, I remember that I used to travel there and so I spoke of it with my sib who goes there to study. They were rather surprised. Well, I can't blame them. For years I secluded myself from interacting with anyone. I shutdown all of my contacts. I antagonized over the family who accepted me. <strong>I betrayed everyone</strong>. I was alone.</p>
    <p>Going back to the relevant events, I travelled once again with my sib towards the campus, since even if I remember and <em>do know</em> what to commute and how to get there, they also have something to get from the uni. For me I just have to turn in my <em>completed</em> application form for the entrance exam and consent on providing my necessary documents.</p>
    <p>We arrived smoothly, but rather a bit sticky despite the AC's aid as the heat gives its best to decimate our populace. Good thing I always bring a handkerchief, truly one of humanity's technological advancement. We parted ways once we got inside as from a glance, the number of applicants, with determination or not, rivals that of an average basketball court. Or perhaps just lower it a little. Anyways there's just too many students applying for the courses, ready to kill one another (figuratively). Competitive or not, everyone's on their eyes for the prize. No one's backing down. May it be the killing heat or a possible cosmic end of all of us, nothing will budge the few from their chairs. While others may just use this as their backup choice, few are deadset to get in with this being their first and last opportunity. This is a battle royale. No one's victor nor loser in this war. Only the promising (and rather well-prepared) remains.</p>
    <p>And so I started from the tail of the line. After a couple of minutes I made it on a chair. Then to the next. And so on. If only that was easy as I put it into words but in the reality, the actual hell, was the anxiety spreading across everyone while we wait for more couple of minutes before progressing our chairs. Good thing is that about the quarter portion of the line lies on the basketball court where volleyball players were fighting. It helped everyone's anxiety lessen to none (I think), and kept some being entertained. In my case, I wasn't really anxious at the time. I guess I had enough of it years ago. It was more like annoyed because of the weather and how little sleep I had as I was reading a manga last night. In any case, I was really looking forward to handle my files to the representatives.</p>
    <p>After hours have passed I finally made it close to the end of the line's quarter part. From there 2 people evaluates if the form's completely filled with necessary details and that it is free from any errors. I handed over mine, confident that I filled everything with needed details. I was wrong. They pointed what year I graduated and what section I used to attend to. Immediately I knew the reason. While that I do know when I graduated, I kept my memories so locked up that they didn't surfaced up until most of them did now.</p>
    <p>From that classroom, the warmth I once had, everyone and everything I believed in, <b>it was there that I betrayed everyone</b>. Their expectations, their views, their words, hopes, our bonds, love, and most importantly, the trust we all had, I made a countless mistake one after another, which is why I know the name of our section. I knew it from the start. I know the words. I know the letters. The numbers. The moments we shared there.</p>
    <p>My achievements meant nothing. In the end they matter most to me, but regardless, the history won't deny that I treated them like garbage. I loathed myself for years. I despised everything and ran away.</p>
    <p>I wrote it together with the date I graduated from my alumni. The pen felt heavy. My chest ached. And the paper was finally filled out correctly from that point.</p>
    <p>I waited and waited, and waited. And still waited. It was not done yet, as we moved upstairs, we were harshly welcomed with another layer of hell, that is, another but last quarter of the line. While it's true that my mind was filled with rather unpleasant details, I got a grip and went back to reality. No anxiety whatsoever, I waited patiently again.</p>
    <p>My turn to give in the application came at last. Without hesitation, albeit a bit distracted, I turned in my form. I was right from the start something was bugging me. Remember the bit that I'm a slow and stupid person? From the words alone, <em>'freshman'</em> is untainted, and what I meant by that is in means of enrollment, meaning that they're newly graduated from a level and so is just about to enroll for a course for the first time.</p>
    <p>It struck me from the start, but I didn't want to rely on anyone. I never asked one. I didn't bothered to look up for specific details and only scanned what the form had and their website. I didn't thoroughly browsed the internet as I'm afraid that it'll prove my hunches right. And the person in charge made it clear. I'm no longer a freshman. Not once but twice I'm tainted.</p>
    <p>I was once accepted to a prestigious, well-known uni that brought up promising scholars.It was a huge university. I know I made it, but at the time, I was really all over the place and unstable. Rather, I was forced to. There was a time I finally broke down and destroyed most records of my academic progress and achievements just so that I would be free from everything. Just so that I can escape. It was from then I came to despise anything related to education, which is why I abstained from reading nor even scanning my books here. I blew everything. <strong>I betrayed everyone again</strong>.</p>
    <p>Back to the recent happenings, when they saw the date from which I graduated, they knew something was wrong from the start. The gap of years from when I graduated, and to this day I'm applying, were just too huge. It's a fucking abyss. A void. Abnormal. Questionable. Probably something happened. Yes. A lot. I can't talk about. Not even to my. Not even to them. Not to anyone. No one.</p>
    <p>They saw, they knew something's wrong, and they explained it concisely and carefully. Even to my current mental state, their words were clear to me. I know what must be done.</p>
    <p>I'm really thankful for them for being thoughtful. With that, I head on outwards. Met my sib on the court, and together went back beyond their gates.</p>
    <p>My sib asked me if I was hungry. Indeed. My famished self declared: <em>"My Venom can't hold on any longer"</em> whilst doing monstrous, stupid gestures. They chuckled and agreed to grab some snacks on a 7/11 branch nearby. I'm really a shitty person so I couldn't ask for more but these mundane moments.</p>
    <p>We got there and I instantly recognized the place. While the items weren't the same before, even after years, the <em><strong>very</strong></em> same layout remained. It wasn't a happy memory, but it did came back nonetheless. Another pain. It made me laugh a bit, excited partially too.</p>
    <p>["I really did came back."]</p>
    <p>["What a cruel joke."]</p>
    <p>["..."]</p>
    <p>I made a couple jokes, nonsensical ones of that, to my sib. It's my coping mechanism at times. I know they were getting distracted from it and were having a hard time on choosing something to drink so I left them alone. I chose a huge bottled lemon-flavored C2. For them its a large bottle of a distilled water. For snacks, we agreed just to buy when we got to our next destination before hitting home. And so to the counter we proceeded.</p>
    <p>They asked me if I wanted some meat buns. I did looked at some but they were unappetizing to me (in those presented forms at least) and so I just declined the offer.</p>
    <p>I'm just minding my own business. Looking around useless signs and alike. Just for a reason. For some reason, some sort of force, it made me look to a certain direction.</p>
    <p>From that moment, that very presence, even if with changes in vanity, I won't ever make a mistake of that very existence. When I turned around I found who was the one standing just in front of me.</p>
    <p>They were what was once everything.</p>
    <p>Our eyes met. I quickly averted my gaze. I had a lot of questions in my head. I had a lot of feelings mixed up together and cannot describe.</p>
    <p>In the end, even amidst the uncertainty with what's going on me, I decided to get some air outside. I smiled. I don't know why but the encounter elevated me. I know that I once had thoughts that with such encounter would spell immediate death for me. That I would end myself on the spot. But those are just thoughts I once had. I was happy at the moment. I really know that I did. Even everything, despite thinking of ending myself for years, I'm happy that they exists. I'm glad. They didn't gave up. I'm glad. I'm really really glad.</p>
    <p>After getting some air I got to sort myself out. Going back inside the AC-cooled store, I went to my sib without ever looking back again from that spot. I just know that it's them. They're alive and doing well. That's enough.</p>
    <p>With that I can finally move on with everything I've got. Without any hesitation nor attachments from the past. Or so I thought. Frankly, I'm convinced a long time ago that whenever I'm complacent just because one good thing happens after another, one calamity falls the next day. And so it did, but at the next moments once we were in the house.</p>
    <p>Regardless, during the trip back to home, I kept making jokes to my sib and I just can't control myself over it. I know it's just me coping again from what I just saw at the time. I can't help it. Even with joy, I was also feeling a bit fear of everything.</p>
    <p>I kept asking them if they saw something from 7/11, and they just don't know what I was talking about. Because if they did, they'll know right away what I was hinting to and say it to my face regardless of my past.</p>
    <p>I went silent. The burned calories caught up to me. The jeepney kept pressing on. Eventually we reached our next destination. We crossed the road through the white lines, and headed to the terminal of various commutable vehicles. We went to the jeepney which lacks 2 last people and departed right away. Yes. Away again from these lands which I had painful memories from. Away from everything that once was.</p>
    <p>We travelled in silence. I kept thinking and thinking. Then we finally arrived. We crossed the bridge, we had the last commute by a yellow tricycle, and waited once again 'til we arrived home.</p>
    <p>My heart is still wavering given everything that happened and I still yet to process. Even so still, I took a step inside the house. It's my home. Old. Filled with unpleasant words and seemingly stagnant time. But it's home. There were some pleasant memories too. It's home.</p>
    <p>I'm home.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="date">March 4, 2025</p>
    <p>Because of my huge ass it was painful to get up. My posture is doomed from the start I'm finally deep in my dreams. It was an agonizing 6:30AM in the morning when I stretched my body so that I could start preparing my other things. I hastily browsed for clothes I could work on shamelessly in public.</p>
    <p>I may be old but my physique remains small, so majority of my clothes were just enough to fit even in my early years. I do have some mature clothings but I see that they don't fit me at all. Obviously one of the factors is that they're either too long or big.</p>
    <p>While it was a struggle I managed to get something in between. A beige coat with lots of pockets to offer, which suits my taste not just for the style but for the convenience as well.</p>
    <p>Then it was finally time to go on the uni's main campus. It was a long ride, a total of 6 commutes when moving out and going back home. Hassle but easy to remember. Also it helps that just like in a city I used to travel into, the landmarks there were mostly churches too. I still find it creepy that they're always built <em>exactly</em> around spots that involve travelling towards to universities, but I digress. Anyways, when I finally made it to the grounds of the campus it felt amazing. It was university week but even so people filled the campus, still, there were areas that's enough to get a shade on against the killing 42 degrees Celsius. A basketball play is ongoing on the gym grounds. Volleyball to the next. Food and accessory stalls from left and right just outside these buildings. Everyone is doing their own thing, and living their own moments.</p>
    <p>It was kinda funny as I shouldn't be in the premises for not having an appointment nor  any form of ID, so I just casually <strike>infiltrated</strike> entered with the help of my sib's ID. I learned a lot on living AMONG US and blending in. It's fun, such a perverse and only twisted mind would do this inhumane and devilish act.</p>
    <p>Jokes aside, I observed everything I could see at the time. Most people were having fun, others were anxious, few were not in a good mood, and so on. It's just a normal day. Various shades of color. Not something you'll see on your room, not even in your entire house nor town. It's a truth that I can only see at that moment. Had I not mustered up my courage to step on inside their premises, I won't be able to see those peoples, nor have such moments, shared or not.</p>
    <p>My legs were sore but I'm glad that I came a lot of places to see and experience for myself. I did it all for myself. I made myself happy. I turned something dull into something warm. I was able to hold onto happiness. For that moment it didn't slipped off my hands. I grabbed it.</p>
    <p>Yet after another bit of time, me and my sib met with few of their classmates and even with their partner. We rest for a while in their partner's home. I'm socially awkward so I could only respond to some questions thrown at me, and I can only talk about their ongoing uni project. As we rest I used my foggy head to think about my uni application and the necessary documents. I need to keep thinking just so I want fall to slumber due to the weather and burned calories.</p>
    <p>Being rejuvenated, we went back to uni so both of them could get their attendance. It's a uni week but another inconsiderable prof is what we're talking about here so they have no choice but to write their names and signatures on a yellow pad from a representative if they don't want to be listed as <em>absent</em>. Again, there were no classes at the time. Some people are just stupid to handle and consider these issues. We wait another set of heat from the unforgiving weather until they finally got their attendance on paper. Good thing that a classmate of them just arrived to the campus, and so they just left the paper in their hands.</p>
    <p>With that, we're ready to go home, however there's still some business their partner had to attend and so my sib accompanied them on trip. We parted ways around a common avenue.</p>
    <p>I don't really have any fond memories in that area nor the city which the uni is located from. They're all unnecessary for my life. But I guess it was all in the past and was too old to wither that I didn't cared at all but to enjoy my time visiting all these places. Surely, it pains me to see the places I used to travel for a reason, but that reason is all gone now, and I can only focus on what matters to me most. I can only walk towards to what I have and need to grab on my sight. I'm no longer bound by that old reason, and for that I'm finally free to roam those lands.</p>
    <p>I went home. Took a short nap. And in the end I'm finally free.</p>
    <p>In the end I'm me. Only me.</p>

    <p>I went to the plaza and had my picture taken. The 2x2 image will be used for an application form, as I'm going to take an entrance exam. It was easy because the place wasn't filled with a mob. When I got home, aside from the typical <em>doomscroll</em> ritual, I scoured my things to find my academic achievements and proof that I finished certain levels.</p>
    <p>I mostly spent my life neither trusting nor believing myself, hence underestimating what I was in the process. With that, it completely slipped out of my mind that I did have some academic achievements, like being a Dean's lister, and that I was capable of it. Even if I was stupid (and still is), I gave effort to everything which made it possible. Given that I was mentally struggling at the time, I was able to reach such goals. I was a student. A learner.</p>
    <p>Anyways I was overjoyed that I still have these things as I'm convinced I got rid of my certificates, i.e. leaving medals and badges only. As for the reason why these remaining certificates and diploma still exist is that the school was late on releasing them.</p>
    <p>Moving forward, after getting back not only my certificates but my medical records as well, I finally gathered my books, as well as my cheatsheet reviewers (e.g. SI units, formulas, chemistry, etc.). I don't know, maybe I just really miss them. That these merely mundane moments simply made me happy. I just don't know what came to me. The sense of relief is just there. I felt hope itself.</p>
    <p>I was reanimated, really alive at this moment. <em>I was able to give a little effort, a small ripple, a tiny step</em> towards the next day.</p>
    <p>Oh and uh yeah, aside from a bit of art and coding, I also <em>deeply</em> cleaned my sports shoes for my departure tomorrow. I rarely clean it to the point that it looks new so I'm glad I did a good job on such a small and unimportant task.</p>

    <p>I had shorten my hair in a salon. Too much time had passed before it was my turn to get cut as there were too much customers at the time. I went there around 5PM and got home around 9PM, which is insane considering that it's only few blocks away from my home. Well, I still find it rather comforting to have them a lot of customers as I don't want them to shutdown.</p>
    <p>In the entire afternoon, the kids' obnoxious noise is everywhere. I do envy their energy and will to spend the day. Free from responsibilities and worries. I have no choice but to endure it in silence, which I was successful with. As for the adults I can't really say the same. I don't really like sharing bits of my life to anyone, especially to strangers, but since they kept pushing me questions and it felt rather rude to ignore them, I gave vague answers with a slight of truth behind them.</p>
    <p>I'm not a fan of opening up myself to anyone, given to what happened to me in the past. Anyways, aside from that, I find it rather inappropriate for the owner to play a podcast about sex. Even if it was censored (e.g. the act itself and the terms for genitals), and even if there are only adults on the room at the time, it was really uncomfortable and suffocating.</p>
    <p>Despite that, I just gave it a try to understand what's going on in their head. Regardless, I can't really find any other place as they do good service and it's fully AC (minus the aformentioned negative stuff) for a good price.</p>
    <p>Indeed it was exhausting. Waiting for hours. Walking back and forth. But I got my refreshing short stylish hair in the end. It was all worth it.</p>

            <h2 class="aspect">Works for Oneself, Originally</h2>
            <p class="description">Remember that you create not just for others, but most importantly <strong>for yourself</strong> too. I believe that the internet wasn't only meant to connect us but also to be a bridge on sharing our own tunes and colors. We express ourselves not just so to 'validate' our purpose or existence, but mainly so that even a single person can here us, and hopefully come to an understanding--<strong>especially</strong> ourselves as it is also a mirror. So create something for yourself and let others see you a bit clearer in pixels (does this make any sense I guess I have to rewrite this topic later). <strong>Social media is designed so that its algorithm dictates what matters and what isn't.</strong></p>

        <section class="subject">
            <h2 class="aspect">Copying is Cheating, Not Love</h2>
            <p class="description"><em>"Copy is an act of love"</em> or something between those lines is a huge lie. It promotes laziness and theft. One could not learn what they desire to make unless they create it out of <strong>inspiration</strong>, not a direct or a bit modified replica. If one wants to spread love, do it by being inspired with someone, and not by taking what they've worked hard for and <em>'claiming'</em> it as your creation. <strong>There's no love and respect towards the creator with copying, only an act of spitting on to their face.</strong></p>

        <section class="subject">
            <h2 class="aspect">Web3 is An Idea to Imprison the Internet</h2>
            <p class="description"><em>"Web3 is the future"</em> is one of the most intellectually challenged notion. The blockchain aims for scarcity, whilst the web itself, with what we have now, isn't for the most part. As long as one has a data connection they can freely surf with anywhere they like to, while taking some limitations into account of course. <strong>It is not decentralized and will never be.</strong> As long as it involves control and money, there are greedy people who will take the opportunity to get data and manipulate everything. With that being said, <strong>no, you still don't own nor control your data there.</strong> The Web3 services will have that 'covered' just as your average corporate fuck.</p>

        <section class="subject">
            <h2 class="aspect">GenAI is Helping No One</h2>
            <p class="description">As countlessly have been mentioned already by numerous creators, it doesn't magically give anyone an art or any form of media from nothing, no, it steals from everything that's publicly accessible online without the knowledge nor consent from the original creators. It isn't even just a matter of environmental impact nor legalities, it's about trampling on everyone's endeavors, identities, feelings, memories, and experiences. <strong>It is an insult to life itself</strong>, as mentioned by a well-known director in the animation industry.</p>

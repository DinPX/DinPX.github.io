            <p>I'm tired but I really need to finish this this day--I know that I can. Right now I'm adding the lowpoly models I worked on. However, it won't be done right away as even if I already have my GIFs for them, they unoptimized, and I don't want that. I'll work on them one by one, starting from their raw text file (for picoCAD) into exporting them as GIFs. I have my backup of files to my local storage but I'll still double check everything just in case. UGH! So much to do!!</p>

            <p>I updated a lot of stuff to my stuff to my website, archived some sites, and started playing Pokemon TCG Pocket. Most of the changes on the website would likely to be not visible at all, still.</p>

            <p>Regardless, now it has Resources and Commissions pages. The microblog window/section was also added to homepage. CSS have been refactored/updated in some areas (I've been thinking of turning it into a entire framework, but eh).</p>
            
            <p>Resources contains all links, credits, and archived pages I have. This is simply a bookmarks and resource dump overall--all for the sake of preservation. I worked a lot on the CSS side so the content is a bit short for now, and it will still take more time to put all my bookmarks and resources there. Speaking of CSS, thanks to its own style I managed to update Gallery and Commissions pages' styles as well.</p>

            <p>I also started playing Pokemon TCG Pocket and it's really fun! Currently I have MewTwo ex, Charizard ex, full art foil Porygon, and other promo art cards. What captivated me is how they nailed the rendering of the cards, it was simply amazing! The depth of the effects really free its limiting canvas to reach the artwork's full potential! I think most artists who worked on these cards were happy to see the 3d effects (or not, if for some reasons). Nevertheless it was really a fun game and I want to get more beautiful cards (to obsess and look at hours) in the future.</p>
            
            <p>(I'll probably make a shrine of my cards someday.)</p>

            <h3>Artistic; Decline</h3>
            <p>
                Over these past months I found myself lost in identity, purpose, and meaning. It was really depressing that I'm just bedrotting each day. My art isn't getting any better, I'm always distracted, and everything felt falling apart. I'm unsatisfied of what I built for myself so far, and art never felt the same--I created content for the sake of content. As much as I want to express myself, when I do, it doesn't really matter and it more like interacting to a wall, really. It felt like I have to be this consistent character, an unmoving figure if you will, just to please everyone according to their tastes--the reason why they followed me in the first place. Having the same type of theme or <em>content</em> makes my art more appealing, more visible to everyone. However I can't, for the sake of my sanity and humanity, my very individual being, I constantly change. Every person does. Everything does. <b>I do change a lot.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Thus I felt stuck with my sanity gradually declining and with this mundane content for the sake of content. Every piece that I post regarding my state, my mental health, or simply expressing how did my day went, goes straight into the void, as no one will ever see and feel them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Putting much effort doesn't really guarantee your work's reach and visibility either. Imagine spending days, months, taking enough care for a piece, especially an animation, and it just goes to oblivion. Pieces that I barely care for, made out of spite or boredom with little to no effort and time, tend to get more attention. I hated it. I am not doing art for the sake of views and likes, I'm just tired of having <b>an algorithm decide what is best and what isn't, and what deserves to be shown to everyone</b>. No matter how hard I try to convince myself that these numbers meant nothing, whenever I see something that barely had any effort on it, worse it's a shitpost, I can't help but see mine as a joke for even trying.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from algorithm and poor <em>interactions</em>, there's this AI problem with every technology, but I'll just focus on social media for the sake of the topic. AI is annoyingly, suffocatingly in every platform that is handled by some major corpo. The amount of pain you have to compete and be cautious for against these hoarding robots is insane. Not only you get your hardwork get stolen for free, these bastards get to profit from it. If you have these all bots in your space, then what is your platform even for? Why even bother put humans in it?
            </p>
            <p>
                Feel free to skip this part as this is a rant about this AI problem. Anyways, the thing about AI is that it won't even be a problem if it was built and marketed as <em>a tool to assist humans, especially people who are disabled or who are in need but want to create as much as everyone else, e.g. neurological assistance to put certain graphic tools on screen in action with so much precision, accuracy, and stability</em>, and so much more. But no, they were engineered to steal and print mass copies and content as much as possible with so little time but with so much resources it burns the atmosphere in no time, giving more instability to our climate thus killing thousands of innocent lifeforms who didn't even participated nor know anything about capitalism and economy.

                Just by training a model, it already has nearly 5x of a lifetime carbon emission from a car, and about 57x to an average human lifespan. It's insane. A lifetime carbon footprint made on a single training in a day, just think about it. We could've released much less footprint if we kept our current activities, computers, without the AI technology. Its resource expense is what making it far more impossible to beat this climate crisis.

                Regardless of it, I'm aware that there's Nightshade and Glaze to protect my works (even myself) from AI theft, but I just want to post my works straight away without extra steps that also diminish my works' quality. Sharing works doesn't have to be this complex--it must be seamless and simple. Taking this much steps isn't a client-side, user problem, it's an issue from the one who's providing the platform and are visibly, utterly clueless to their consumers. Moreover, just because I'm not a known artist which gets my works less likely to be prompted by others, that doesn't mean I'm completely safe from art theft. I was also paranoid at the time that I started on recording some timelapses just to prove that <em><b>behind this screen was a human who spent countless times making that art</b></em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adding to all of these was my declining passion in art, may it be the burnout or the lack of interest or both, I'm certain that I no longer find it fun. There's a lot of factors contributing on why such thing happened, and obviously it includes the aforementioned. IRL everyone is chaotic that I can't function, and I'm decaying as an individual so it doesn't help either. I can't connect with everyone, I can't be myself, and I can't even express anything at all. <em><b>Why even live at this point?</b></em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Art was the only thing I was able to regain myself after some trauma. I was able to find myself a purpose, and I was able to give myself a worth. It allowed myself to walk outside again, talk to some people I knew, to some strangers, buy me some food, a warm beverage to drink, a warm comforter to sleep with, new clothes to wear and express myself with, and so much more I started to live as a normal human being again. Eventually I became bad with art, and I meant not only the quality, but the ideas and motivation behind it. This was the only thing that gave me purpose and meaning, and without it, <em><b>then what am I</b></em>? The need and act for art was necessary for me to function, but then it was making me suffer that I cannot do anything at all. Regardless of my physical health, if I'm still mentally unwell I won't be able to move forward.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given that, even if I give my best, if algorithms, AI, bots, anything anti-user get to control everything in the entire space, making it less useful for us real humans, making it more difficult for our works reach more other living beings behind these screens, I might as well as give up to these platforms just like everybody else. It's not worth fighting or struggling for. I'm just exhausted of the cycle and I want to rest from this. I rather focus on my mental health and well-being than be another braindead consumer that fuels these corporations who doesn't give an ounce of fuck to their users because they have nothing to lose.
            </p>
            <p>
                These major, known parts of the internet is dead, utterly boring, and had lost their personality just like their owners. I refuse to be part of them, to be like them, to express myself with their bare minimum. They have this product targeted for us humans and they can't even protect us from robots' populace, much worse, they're the ones encouraging it. They do everything they can to milk the pieces we worked so hard for. We're nothing but products for their advertisers, nothing more than that.

                The internet felt so bland and fake, and it's because of everything being simplified in design, limiting features for its users (notably customizations), AI-generated content, and media that are no longer a form of expression but are made to gather numbers and advertisements. Even with all of these, creative web is not dead, and we can fight for it by supporting pro-creator sites like BlueSky, Cara.app, Mastodon, and websites in Neocities and Nekoweb.

            <p>
                I started revisiting my interests in old web, emulation, obscure media and tech, and coding in general, and it was really refreshing to me. The once long gone pieces that constitutes my entire being were recovered--I felt as myself again, reinvigorated, reanimated even. I am alive seeing these footages of grown pieces of hardware, software, and media. I might have not been part of most of them due to the gaps in years when I was spawned into reality, but I do still adore their very own existence. Thankful and glad that these objects who have nothing to do with me were existing in their prime at some point, with more relevance, and was able to make a mark in history, and even to this day still amazes people like me.
            </p>
            <p>
                Admittedly, I am not knowledgeable when it comes to the technical details to a machine's anatomy, nevertheless I have this mild obsession and interest with them. I do want to make some time for hardware in the future, but that comes after securing stability in other aspects of my life, I can only do few things at the moment just so as to stay alive and sane. Anyways, continuing to the topic, to think that these things that are much older than me, stays relevant and builds awesome communities that supports them to the point that they still work to the modern internet is beyond amazing and just tells a lot on how people care about preservation and history of our technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                This part is a rant so feel free to skip it. Corporations don't give a fuck and would cut the life out of these systems as long as their competitors sell something new in the market, not even preservation is in their dictionary. After all, it is a race whose technology is the latest, and best in presentation even. True, there are some exceptions in some forms that preserves them, for instance N*ntendo has their own museum for their creations in the past, but that doesn't necessarily mean they continue the production of these titles and other owned IPs for there are more things the newer technology could present to the mass consumers, and so they will go for the obvious route. They may have brought older medias back thru their own emulations but they as slow and unoptimized as they can get to their own hardware. Not to mention that they are in digital format, not in physical media, which is worse. Adding to this is they are glad to shut down countless emulators and ROM/hacking sites that do much better job at preserving their media, when these community projects had no any visibly negative effect nor impact on their profits given their large number of loyal consumers.

                Going back to the main topic of this section, which was about the old web, obscure media and tech, and anything between these, it's cool to see that they are alive to this day, and fully functional to some degree even. I'm not really a fan of much slimmer devices nowadays, as aside from being usually bland in design, in durability they tend to be fragile. Well they're convenient to fit in a lot of spaces so I'll give them that, but bulkier devices are more hot and has more personality with them--obviously they tend to be more durable too.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the modern devices, for instance the Andri*d smartphones, comes in lots of flavors, it doesn't hold a candle compared to the variations available in the past--the designs and applications are absurd, the creativity was skyrocketing like bananas. There's a huge range when it comes to the layout of the buttons and screens, shape and size, and the number of peripherals and accessories they can handle. It revolutionized the trends and the internet culture even to this day.

                This phenomena wasn't only limited to the tangible side of technology, but to software as well. You got a vast array of plugins for your music players, with all these cool and questionable visuals to pick from. Wallpapers that are glossy and explores themes that breaks the barrier between reality and the cyberworld, they were really vibrant, filled with life and hopes for what comes to the future of technology. The creation was only bounded with everyone's imagination and time, and we were robbed of its time too soon.

                I grew up with an original PSP with UMD support and a bootleg GBA SP which games, if I recall correctly, contains flashed "160000" ROMs. Insane right? I was oblivious at the time on why the Gameboy was painfully slow at boot and at certain times, and why it has this library of unnecessary copies of the same group of games. Young me was trying to complete Crash Bandicoot XS and N-Tranced with all that gems and time attacks, but I never did. There's also Digimon Battle Spirit 2, Egg Mania, Kurukuru Kururin, a robot-building/fighting game, and a LOTR turn-based RPG, games that I spent hours only to not really beat them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our chunky old PC came with Windows XP installed, and bundled with Virtua Cop 2, Bejeweled 2, Zuma Deluxe, Need for Speed Underground 2, and some Game House Collection. By some, unfortunately not all games can run in our PC. In weekends, we'll go to our cousin and play with their PC, notably because they are connected to the internet. Cartoon Network, Y8, and Friv were our favorite spots in the web, and I'm not sure whether we played Kizi at the time, but I do remember visiting their site too at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course we didn't only spent our time with games, as quite diligent pupils we were once, we also tend to open and browse this cool program by Microsoft called Encarta Kids 2008, and I'm telling you that this is one of the only things I like about that company aside from Windows XP and 7, and yes, even their (formerly) Nokia Lumia.
            </p>
            <p>
                As much as I hated being in school and taking their boring curriculum, the learning materials through from these programs didn't bored me to death at all! I really felt like a student than a capitalist slave trainee for the future. Dinosaurs, human anatomy, origin of halloween, various art movements, history of film, parts of a bicycle, animal behaviours and habitats, everything's in it! Well almost everything to be exact, and it was outdated when it comes to information as again, we had no internet connection at the time. Not to mention they also come with a dictionary and a rather advanced scientific calculator which came pretty handy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from all of these, we also used to play our PSP 3000 a lot. Our game library has Lego Batman (iirc the name), Bliss Island, Ben 10 Protector of Earth, Dragon Ball Z Shin Budokai Another Road, and Invizimals: Shadow Zone, my <em>bias</em> from all of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game really captured me when I saw the clean, glossy and vibrant renders of the monsters on the UMD cover. I was entranced with the in-game visuals and UI, the visual and sound design (particularly with the Invizimals Catalog), and most importantly, the 3d models of the Invizimals. There is so much data for my brain to input into a messy information soup. God this game was a blessing especially considering the limitations of hardware at the time, the team behind it managed to push its limits, and take advantage of the AR technology. I was really bummed out when no one in our area knows what Invizimals is, as you would've guessed, Pokemon took over the world. Don't get me wrong, I love Pokemon too and mostly around the GBA releases (and currently adding the MOBA Pokemon UNITE), but it would be awesome to have Invizimals to be as relevant, popular, and one of its competitors in the genre and market. Anyways that's all for now about Invizimals, Shadow Zone specifically, as I'll save more details for the shrine. Overall, I love Invizimals and I'd like to see what it could have been in these days.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given with the absurd prices of the hardware, I decided to not invest yet to them considering the necessities I need to live everyday. So in order to have new experiences with these relics, I have the emulation on my side. With it I also got to try other titles that I've never been into before. I get to read more information about these games on their wikis, forums, and even in the social media that I never got to bother doing back then. Due to circumstances, I no longer possess my original copies of my games, and so emulation is the solution I decided to go with, plus, it works even better on my hardware performance-wise (minus the lack of peripherals or intended controllers/accessories). With it and these amazing communities that keep these titles alive, my connection on the games lives to this day.
            </p>
            <p>
                So yeah, the major contributing factors to why I love the old web, tech, and media is because of these things I had in my life. They really shaped me to creative endeavors and pursuit.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a momentarily end of reminiscing the good things we had in the past. It doesn't necessarily mean that I have to let go of them just to move forward when I can walk with them in the process. Discarding them meant the gradual disappearance of what I am as today. I don't like the old things because I want to live with those times and be myself in the past, rather, I want to walk alongside with them into the future with who I am today and will ever be.

            <h3>Re; Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                And so with all these fiasco, I decided to ditch Windows 10 and switch to Linux Mint completely. It was a pain to setup due to display and audio driver issues, as well as boot up problems, but after several attempts of reviving my laptop I managed to make it stable and fully functional as intended. Unlike from my previous attempts, this I would say the <em>'final stable'</em> installation I have so far. I'll write a separate blog on the horrors I encountered when dealing with this OS, anyways, moving on.
            </p>
            <p>
                I tested Aseprite, the binary that I bought from their Humble Bundle, and there were only brief lags when moving and zooming the canvas, as for stroking the brush it goes smoothly as it can. I really hated the Steam release due to how unusable it is even with the compatibility layer it offers. As much as I needed to switch my setup, I still want to hold on with my laptop and get the most out of it given the limitations--I want to preserve it. I'll assemble a new setup sooner or later as I need to renovate my workspace.
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking of software, my Aseprite works well, and I got both stable VSCodium and Librewolf which works blazingly fast, which could imply that I <em>properly</em> partitioned my SSD this time. Given these, I'm pretty much glad with my current setup--Mint is clean, simple, and customizable to an extent (I'm using XFCE).
            </p>
            <p>
                Tech stuff aside, I also managed to track my habits, to-do's, and moods. Albeit I haven't tracked my sleeping behavior yet. My thoughts about it is that it's kinda neat to have this database you can peek into and see notes of what you did and feeling on that day. You get to reflect at some points, and probably be able to make better decisions at the present. Anyways, I'm taking care of myself, and that's a huge step for me--I was able to see my worth beyond art, beyond my body, beyond the numbers I'm making online and in reality. That's why I'm really thankful to these software (although it would be cool for the DailyBean to work offline), I'm able to record my progress. You see, my brain cannot retain too much information, not even crystal clear, regarding my experiences, as I got used to repressing my emotions and memories from the past (this would be a topic to a different time), so these apps really saved me on keeping a journal.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'd like to get back on my journal and blog entries someday, look back at my writings from my experiences, and laugh at it. Think about how far I've come. How it was this simple all this time. That I'm still learning a lot of things despite of my age. That I'm perfect as being the imperfect being I am. That I grew. That I became a proper adult. That I managed to live a fulfilling life to the end. That I'll be satisfied even after death. That this is the Din that once lived to this generation, era, and the very fabric of reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're reading this 20 years from now, Din, I just have a question for you.
            </p><br>
            <p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0;">
                "How are you, and the things going on right now?"
            </p><br>
            <p>
                I know that you can do it. Keep coming up whenever you see yourself down in the mud. Keep moving on under the heavy rains. No strong winds will ever send you away far from these lands. Just keep on getting up.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alright, that's enough for the cringe bits. Regardless of the journals and habit tracking apps, it won't do anything if I don't do my part. Being depressed and miserable is okay, but staying as is isn't. If I want changes to happen I have to start from myself, I'm the one that will make things possible and happen. This is the sole purpose of my webpages and partaking in the web revival movement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything starts now.

            <h3>End; Start</h3>
            <p>
                I'm going to be actively working on both art and web dev, and eventually be back on game dev as well. That's how I'd like to live my life starting this day. It would be a tough road as there's a lot of obstacles in the way, but those won't matter.

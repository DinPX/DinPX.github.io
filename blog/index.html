            <p><em>I think what brings the worst of us is that we constantly walk towards the brief pleasure of being alive, and so death is a gentle, eternal reminder for us to do better.</em></p>

            <p>This is a rant for whatever wrong is going on with the world which most people actively dismiss solely to live a brief comfort moment and not yearn (fight off even) for a much better, not dehumanizing society. If you like how things work that violence, slavery, and other degeneracy is allowed in plain sight, and that the next generation should be working under inhumane conditions, perpetually turning the cogs, and doesn't deserve a promising future, please, do yourself a favor and turn into fertilizer 6ft deep underground. Thank you.</p>

            <p>Personally, given all the problems we have in this world, I think even in the amidst of the possibility that someday higher extraterrestrail beings will try to conquer us, or kaijus will rise up from the depths of the sea and decimating half of the entire populace, we as human beings will still find opportunities from dire situations to profit from them. Death is profitable. Injuries can cost an arm and leg. And we're just that stupid. Even if some monster shows up and started blasting people, we'll argue whether the monsters' actions are immoral, woke, religious or political. It's insane how sensitive and active we are when it comes to one's ideologies and actions, but never been too responsible to make the right choices for everyone.</p>

            <h4 id="Pigsty Consumerism">Pigsty Consumerism</h4>

            <p>By this point it is no surprise that one of the most clicked content over the Internet are things that revolve around endless drama, tragedy, and stupid agendas. It's much easier to make a content that is favored by the unholy algorithm and bless everyone with a bite-size slop. Just perfect, for the degrading attention span and critical thinking. Given the commercialized space, most sites are designed in such a way for quick profit and control over the information. There's no need for creativity when you can simply vulture over other's scraps and call it a day. One slop over the other, one hate after another, as simple as that. Don't even get me started with AI brainrot.</p>

            <p>Back in the early 2000s the Internet is still in its infancy, even commercial products, were undergoing countless experiments that are risky but provided every consumers a wide variety of creative, innovative, and lively products and content. Unlike the dystopian minimalistic corporate aesthetics being shoved down in our throats now, the designs and themes are just unique and can identify with so many people.</p>

            <p>This is prevalent to the flip phones in history:</p>

            <blockquote>"The market was flooded with diverse flip phone models offering different features to cater to consumer preferences. These phones featured color displays, built-in cameras, text messaging capabilities, and basic internet browsing. They provided a range of options for consumers with varying needs and budgets. For example, the Nokia 7200 series featured unique designs and interchangeable covers, allowing users to customize their phones to reflect their personal style."</blockquote>
            
            <blockquote>"Style and Fashion Statement: Flip phones became fashionable accessories, <u>reflecting personal style</u> and status. They were <u>available in various designs, colors, and finishes, allowing users to express their individuality</u> through their choice of phone."</blockquote>

            <blockquote class="blockEnd">"Affordability: Flip phones <u>offered options at different price points</u>, making them <u>more accessible to a wider range of consumers</u> compared to high-end smartphones.

            </blockquote><br>

            <p>While profit is the goal, they provided innovative creations that founded and shaped the things we enjoy now:</p>

            <blockquote>"The 20th century witnessed a surge in innovation and the creation of iconic toys that would shape generations of childhoods. Lego, invented by Ole Kirk Christiansen in Denmark, revolutionized construction toys, <u>promoting creativity and problem-solving skills</u>. In the United States, the advent of plastic manufacturing led to the mass production of toys like Barbie dolls, G.I. Joe action figures, and the iconic Mr. Potato Head."</blockquote>

            <blockquote class="blockEnd">"The mid-20th century also saw the emergence of electronic toys, with the introduction of battery-powered and electronic components. The Easy-Bake Oven, introduced by Kenner in the 1960s, allowed children to bake miniature treats with a light bulb. The popularity of electronic toys soared in the following decades with the <u>rise of video games, handheld electronic devices, and interactive toys."</u>

            <blockquote>"1986's Metroid and its SNES sequel, in particular, are touchstone titles in what has now unquestionably become its own genre. The first in the series introduced many console gamers to the idea of a large, explorable 2D platforming world; in 1994, Super Metroid refined that gameplay immensely while adding deft storytelling. Three years after that, Symphony of the Night expanded this formula in all directions, adding both complexity and depth at every turn."</blockquote>

            <blockquote><em>"First off, I didn't like the state of action games at the time,"</em> says Koji "IGA" Igarashi, when asked where 1997's Symphony of the Night came from. <em>"Titles divided into discrete stages were tending to get more and more difficult, leading to the situation where good players quickly finished them and beginners were no longer getting their money's worth.

            <p>So, compared to what we have now from AAA studios and corpo alike, they have nothing but countless remakes, remasters, and media that would (according to them) cater to 'everyone', which in the end just doesn't work well.</p>

            <p>Despite the limitations of the technology in the early years, development teams were able to be creative enough and push the limits of hardware to their untapped potential. Palette swaps were applied to deliver more colors to various levels and sprites; 4 channels (usually) and sometimes an extra for samples were used to make rather complex background musics; raycasting to present 2d graphics in a pseudo 3d render; <i>.kkrieger</i> created by <i>.theprodukkt</i>, is an FPS game that fits in 96kb size; fogs were used in the PS1 Silent Hill to hide distant objects being loaded; some sprites in NES Kirby's Dream Land are cut into 2 to save space and allow reusability; and so much more.</p>

            <p>Prior to the current state of AAA games, titles shipped were finished and are in a playable state. Now, large studios focus on creating games that are colossal in size, too buggy in release, filled with 'micro' transactions, mostly are live service, doesn't have any single player or local coop mode, and so much more. It's embarassing given how technologically advance we are now but we got these incompetent releases. The old media storage then weren't as impressive as to what we use now, and so devs have to be creative enough in order to make games fully work, with less to no bugs noticeable in release, whilst working under very limiting conditions, and they made it possible (looking at you, my beloved DOOM, PSP, and GBA games). Nowadays it's just a race to ship a barely working unoptimized game with uninteresting elements.</p>

            <blockquote>"<u>Big companies like to play it safe and stick with what works.</u> This keeps ROI high, <u>risk low, and investors happy</u>.

            <p>Going to the fast and safe route is beneficial in short-term for shareholders alike, and as such, well known IPs are thrown around only to be tarnished by these people who doesn't even appreciate the art behind these works--they don't know the value and worth that is beyond money.

            <p>My take is to remove censorships to a degree, give the creative freedom to those who actually know their field of expertise and work, and learn how to stop executives from taking control over projects that they barely know about. Just let the devs, directors, writers, artists, musicians, designers and alike do their own job in peace, and learn how to wait patiently and to fuck off.

            <p>Aside from taking risks, please for the love of this simulation, stop being goblins for once, stop fucking things up, and let the studios who provided you the income in the first place by the way, to thrive and let you make more money you intolerable fucks.

You can learn a thing or more from Nintendo (and Rockstar Games of course) if you try hard enough.

Instead of complaining why games are dead nowadays, stop buying those uninspiring AAA garbage, let go of those titles since they've been <i>Frankenstein-ed</i> since the IP acquisition, and buy actual games from well-known or rising indie devs. Perhaps, just a big IF, if no attention and pocket were given to these clueless executives, they'll turn a new leaf and be a bit kind towards their teams and the players alike.</p>

            <p>I can't believe just when I already forgot about his existence and even haven't touched my X account for how long now, I'm back to day 0. Anyways, in Trumpet's recent inauguration, he purposefully made the salute of a certain notorious figure in history. This is a huge red flag and he sure knows what he's doing. Taking on the X platform was a mistake, and with him leading it, the misinformation will rise, hate will spread, and more people will unfortunately worship him, Trumpet, and anything in their circle. Surely he's aware of how he's portrayed and ridiculed by people who isn't buying his lies, and so most of his actions are driven out of spite and solely to feed his ego in my opinion--that's what fulfills his purpose and very being.</p>
            
            <p>Recently, speaking of his image, he was accused of boosting (having someone to 'pilot') his account in Path of Exile 2 over his poorly played stream, which experienced players quickly caught on to. Look, I don't play the game and so I have no idea how all of its mechanics and meta work, but what I do no is to never trust his deceptive character given the years he had built his image. Given the aforementioned, this is just one of their days of casually lying about their reputation and so it won't be a surprise that the platform will be used for their advantage to their agendas--take what happened to Asmongold's X account for example, which by the way I don't watch nor a fan of him either.</p>

            <p>Remember that Mr. Beast's target audience comprises of minors, even to the likes of Logan and KSI, and so they pose a danger to the young audience by promoting and marketing unhealthy products. They can take advantage of younger people as they can't give criticisms not only towards the products but to the grifters themselves as well. Their audience aren't as knowledgeable when it comes to legalities and aren't that familiar with Mr. Beast and co.'s history, which is why they can always just get away with these practices.</p>

            <p>Overall, I'm frustrated with how irresponsible the people in power are. We let these kind of insufferable idiots to rule us for years with no positive drastic changes whatsoever making it norm for dehumanizing perception, labor, and treatment. I want people to realize that their voice matters, that they are capable of making a positive impact as long as they don't let these creeps get a hold of their critical thinking, decisions, and life--i.e. don't give them the attention and power. One can be that gear to make the machine collapse for something new and better.</p>

            <p>I won't expect much to the people changing their votes on the upcoming election given how many corrupt and unqualified officials have been elected in my country. People just care about how famous and rich politicians here are even if they're uneducated to the position they're aiming for. A lot of actors have gotten their way into the administration, as well as people who have no background whatsoever in law. If people speak up for the truth, regardless if they're journalists, election candidates, or civilians, they'll go missing on the spot or end up with bullet shots. I hate people with power and I truly hope they suffer, e.g. getting incurable diseases for they fuck up the healthcare and research so bad so they got a hell taste of it.</p>

            <p>Why do even people kept falling under these kind of people? They haven't learned a single lesson from previous presidential terms. They rather have the brief gratification for having their votes bought, rather than yearn for a prosperous stable life in a long term under the leadership of a promising leader. I'm sick of it. Frankly, at this point, I don't buy the excuse that they're in-need of financial support which is why they sold their votes, when people tend lean to their egos regarding their beliefs. This is prominent given the lines of <em>"We won! Cry over it. You lost the election.", "I told you so, I'm right! We won this election."</em>, and so on. No you mentally challenged fuck, you didn't won anything, and this isn't even about winning or losing in the first place. This is about being a responsible adult, not repeating the cycle, and providing a better place to the next generation just so they won't end up like us. You fucking disgust me.</p>
            
            <p>I don't even care if it ended friendships at some point, for me it is understandable especially when they have this toxic mindset on politics. They're treating it as a game, and protecting their egos and images in their circle in exchange for a dehumanizing ruling of parasites. They only think about themselves, not the betterment of the whole. Period.</p>

            <p>If you're alright with having a CEO tell you that you should be comfortable of not owning your games, having a president back when they have criminal records, and others that are just questionable, you should get your brain checked for any possible damage.</p>

            <p>In today's era, people are willing to go lengths as long as they get the recognition and numbers that grow their social media presence. Not a single care for any repercussions, and much worse, their actions are even encouraged by the same unhinged and chronically online users. The misuse of the social media and internet as a whole led us to this. Even with the advances in our civilization, we're far from being civilized--my own sanity is dwindling and I'm becoming more uncivil with my wishes for the corrupt. It is my fault for being human and having my fuse run out.</p>

            <p>Keep on playing the character and you won't even know what's real anymore.</p>

There's a lot of good people out there that deserve more peace and stable life and yet these priveledged fucks get to trample down on people who are really in need of help.

            <p>Back on 2023, multiple Israeli TikToks have gained attention for being infamous on mocking Palestinian victims on genocide. They're so sickening that not only they're willing to made fun of the deaths of innocent people that died or have suffered from losses, injuries, and hunger, but also happy to go such lengths that they'll include their kids to their garbage videos. They don't deserve their life, they don't deserve to have kids, and most importantly, they don't deserve to live. In my opinion, if you insult and view someone's life as insignificant and worthless, you deserve to be treated the same way, as disregarding human empathy is the same as insulting humanity and life itself. You don't deserve to be treated as a human if you make fun of other's suffering, take advantage over their bodily autonomy, make other's life more miserable deliberately, and other forms of degeneracy. You don't deserve anything that is humane.</p>

            <p>They have no idea what it feels like to lose a home, to have nothing to return to. I thought when I was a kid that it'll never happen, that these stupid telenovelas are being stale for the same arson-related conflicts. In a moment, our first house was engulfed in flames and my beloved books, drawings, and other things went with it. I almost lost my family. I was like an hour or 2 still processing what just happened, and I no longer recall what my friends asked me on that midnight. Everything was slow and I can only feel the loss and pain at the time. I am very confused what's gonna happen from that point. Everything we had just robbed away in an instant by some cosmic fluke. I fucking hated that fire, why of all things that could happen it did and even chose us?</p>

            <p>Fortunately we have a relative nearby, and so we settled temporarily there. The next morning came and we were asked by our friends again on like how we were doing, what happened during that midnight, or what's going to happen on us siblings from that moment onwards. I simply don't know. I'm a kid, and things just happened too fast. I don't know.</p>

            <p>If I remember correctly it was around my 5th grade when the fire happened. Regardless, fast forward to this day, I hold much dislike to people who cheats, takes advantage of people, etc., and by now as writing this I realize what partially causes it. Just don't ever make fun of others suffering, and don't even bother turning it into a 'fun content'. If you do, you deserve to suffer and die. There's a difference to a sarcastic dark humor vs straight up mockery filled with contempt. Fuck Nas Daily, fuck Mr. Beast, and fuck Loner Musk.</p>

            <p>Most people fail to see why this is a problem unless it's too late and the same horrible things happen to them. Why wait for these to come when we have the means to prevent them from ever happening? These inhumane individuals are also the ones that tend to defend themselves as the victims, and so it is just and righteous to inflict the same pain they had towards the others, which is just an excuse for them to commit killings for pleasure and wealth. News outlets aren't so reliable either for labeling these gruesome events as war instead of genocide. Journalists here in the west don't even try when it comes to properly addressing the numbers of victims and deaths in the headlines, labeling the them instead as casualties and injuries. Not upholding to your integrity in journalism just nullifies your authenticity and profession. You might as well just use your talent on the likes of IGN, they'll surely benefit from you.</p>

            <p>A lot of individuals just seem to lean more in favor of violence and hatred. For instance, aside from the aforementioned mockery of genocide via Israeli Tiktok slops, we have some imageboards and the defunct Liveleak containing uncensored posts of horrific events that shows a death of a person. Now, personally I don't find any problems having those kind of content circling around the internet, especially if they're uncensored as news outlets can source them for legitimacy and accuracy of the events. However, my problem with these contents is that people make fun of the victims, and being 'edgy' in the process. Also the problematic shocker sites doesn't do anything other than devaluing human's lives by turning them into basically jumpscares, which is just straight out disrespectful. By constantly consuming these gorey content, mocking the poor individuals behind it, they're gradually getting desensitized of humanity and basic empathy.</p>

            <p>Internet, social media, imageboards, forums, all of it weren't a mistake, but the misuse of these technology is. Schools particulary the elementary level should always have subjects about computers and proper netiquette, in order to lead the next generation as responsible surfers of the internet, and make them literate enough to manage their own computer, operating systems, antivirus measures, and so on. In short, teaching the proper use of the technology we have will be a good shift to prevent these kind of problems in the social media and cyberspace as a whole. We are at the age that computers play a vital role to the society's growth, i.e. for the circulation of information, communication, and needs, and so we have to let the younger users be prepared and responsible with its usage--so that again, they won't end up like the most of us.</p>

            <p>If most people can be good at using a computer and browsing the internet, and is literate to discern the information they digest from the web space, these acts alone can contribute on combatting against the spread of misinformation, hate speech, and more. It will prevent most pseudoscience, beliefs and alike that can endanger people's lives. It can save mental health and even lives themselves. (Of courses, remember to make some Vitamin D outside. Get some grass.)</p>

I'm saying this as there's no problem with genders (aside from MAPs they can die off a cliff for even considering it, and also zoophiles should die too), in fact thanks to it I get to know more about my identity as I'm unfamiliar with terms and how I'll catergorize myself, and this applies to a lot of us, however, what I find problematic are these crybabies who kept being online whining about how they're being victims when they're the ones in the wrong, and will even dare to escalate things even further.</p>

Again, regardless of your gender, race, or background, this doesn't give you the pass to be a complete asshole to everyone. You're not special (but in a way, yes) and you should be civil.

            <h3>Artistic; Decline</h3>
            <p>Over these past months I found myself lost in identity, purpose, and meaning. It was really depressing that I'm just bedrotting each day. My art isn't getting any better, I'm always distracted, and everything felt falling apart. I'm unsatisfied of what I built for myself so far, and art never felt the same--I created content for the sake of content. As much as I want to express myself, when I do, it doesn't really matter and it more like interacting to a wall, really. It felt like I have to be this consistent character, an unmoving figure if you will, just to please everyone according to their tastes--the reason why they followed me in the first place. Having the same type of theme or <em>content</em> makes my art more appealing, more visible to everyone. However I can't, for the sake of my sanity and humanity, my very individual being, I constantly change. Every person does. Everything does. <b>I do change a lot.</b></p>

            <p>Thus I felt stuck with my sanity gradually declining and with this mundane content for the sake of content. Every piece that I post regarding my state, my mental health, or simply expressing how did my day went, goes straight into the void, as no one will ever see and feel them.</p>

            <p>Putting much effort doesn't really guarantee your work's reach and visibility either. Imagine spending days, months, taking enough care for a piece, especially an animation, and it just goes to oblivion. Pieces that I barely care for, made out of spite or boredom with little to no effort and time, tend to get more attention. I hated it. I am not doing art for the sake of views and likes, I'm just tired of having <b>an algorithm decide what is best and what isn't, and what deserves to be shown to everyone</b>. No matter how hard I try to convince myself that these numbers meant nothing, whenever I see something that barely had any effort on it, worse it's a shitpost, I can't help but see mine as a joke for even trying.</p>

            <p>Aside from algorithm and poor <em>interactions</em>, there's this AI problem with every technology, but I'll just focus on social media for the sake of the topic. AI is annoyingly, suffocatingly in every platform that is handled by some major corpo. The amount of pain you have to compete and be cautious for against these hoarding robots is insane. Not only you get your hardwork get stolen for free, these bastards get to profit from it. If you have these all bots in your space, then what is your platform even for? Why even bother put humans in it?</p>

            <p>Feel free to skip this part as this is a rant about this AI problem. Anyways, the thing about AI is that it won't even be a problem if it was built and marketed as <em>a tool to assist humans, especially people who are disabled or who are in need but want to create as much as everyone else, e.g. neurological assistance to put certain graphic tools on screen in action with so much precision, accuracy, and stability</em>, and so much more. But no, they were engineered to steal and print mass copies and content as much as possible with so little time but with so much resources it burns the atmosphere in no time, giving more instability to our climate thus killing thousands of innocent lifeforms who didn't even participated nor know anything about capitalism and economy.</p>

            <p>This is a table of carbon emissions estimations from NLP models training vs usual consumption from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02243" target="_blank"><em>Energy and Policy Considerations for Deep Learning in NLP</em></a> paper.</p><br>

                Just by training a model, it already has nearly 5x of a lifetime carbon emission from a car, and about 57x to an average human lifespan. It's insane. A lifetime carbon footprint made on a single training in a day, just think about it. We could've released much less footprint if we kept our current activities, computers, without the AI technology. Its resource expense is what making it far more impossible to beat this climate crisis.

                Regardless of it, I'm aware that there's Nightshade and Glaze to protect my works (even myself) from AI theft, but I just want to post my works straight away without extra steps that also diminish my works' quality. Sharing works doesn't have to be this complex--it must be seamless and simple. Taking this much steps isn't a client-side, user problem, it's an issue from the one who's providing the platform and are visibly, utterly clueless to their consumers. Moreover, just because I'm not a known artist which gets my works less likely to be prompted by others, that doesn't mean I'm completely safe from art theft. I was also paranoid at the time that I started on recording some timelapses just to prove that <em><b>behind this screen was a human who spent countless times making that art</b></em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Adding to all of these was my declining passion in art, may it be the burnout or the lack of interest or both, I'm certain that I no longer find it fun. There's a lot of factors contributing on why such thing happened, and obviously it includes the aforementioned. IRL everyone is chaotic that I can't function, and I'm decaying as an individual so it doesn't help either. I can't connect with everyone, I can't be myself, and I can't even express anything at all. <em><b>Why even live at this point?</b></em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Art was the only thing I was able to regain myself after some trauma. I was able to find myself a purpose, and I was able to give myself a worth. It allowed myself to walk outside again, talk to some people I knew, to some strangers, buy me some food, a warm beverage to drink, a warm comforter to sleep with, new clothes to wear and express myself with, and so much more I started to live as a normal human being again. Eventually I became bad with art, and I meant not only the quality, but the ideas and motivation behind it. This was the only thing that gave me purpose and meaning, and without it, <em><b>then what am I</b></em>? The need and act for art was necessary for me to function, but then it was making me suffer that I cannot do anything at all. Regardless of my physical health, if I'm still mentally unwell I won't be able to move forward.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given that, even if I give my best, if algorithms, AI, bots, anything anti-user get to control everything in the entire space, making it less useful for us real humans, making it more difficult for our works reach more other living beings behind these screens, I might as well as give up to these platforms just like everybody else. It's not worth fighting or struggling for. I'm just exhausted of the cycle and I want to rest from this. I rather focus on my mental health and well-being than be another braindead consumer that fuels these corporations who doesn't give an ounce of fuck to their users because they have nothing to lose.

                I started revisiting my interests in old web, emulation, obscure media and tech, and coding in general, and it was really refreshing to me. The once long gone pieces that constitutes my entire being were recovered--I felt as myself again, reinvigorated, reanimated even. I am alive seeing these footages of grown pieces of hardware, software, and media. I might have not been part of most of them due to the gaps in years when I was spawned into reality, but I do still adore their very own existence. Thankful and glad that these objects who have nothing to do with me were existing in their prime at some point, with more relevance, and was able to make a mark in history, and even to this day still amazes people like me.
            </p>

                Admittedly, I am not knowledgeable when it comes to the technical details to a machine's anatomy, nevertheless I have this mild obsession and interest with them. I do want to make some time for hardware in the future, but that comes after securing stability in other aspects of my life, I can only do few things at the moment just so as to stay alive and sane. Anyways, continuing to the topic, to think that these things that are much older than me, stays relevant and builds awesome communities that supports them to the point that they still work to the modern internet is beyond amazing and just tells a lot on how people care about preservation and history of our technology.
            </p>

                This part is a rant so feel free to skip it. Corporations don't give a fuck and would cut the life out of these systems as long as their competitors sell something new in the market, not even preservation is in their dictionary. After all, it is a race whose technology is the latest, and best in presentation even. True, there are some exceptions in some forms that preserves them, for instance N*ntendo has their own museum for their creations in the past, but that doesn't necessarily mean they continue the production of these titles and other owned IPs for there are more things the newer technology could present to the mass consumers, and so they will go for the obvious route. They may have brought older medias back thru their own emulations but they as slow and unoptimized as they can get to their own hardware. Not to mention that they are in digital format, not in physical media, which is worse. Adding to this is they are glad to shut down countless emulators and ROM/hacking sites that do much better job at preserving their media, when these community projects had no any visibly negative effect nor impact on their profits given their large number of loyal consumers.

                Going back to the main topic of this section, which was about the old web, obscure media and tech, and anything between these, it's cool to see that they are alive to this day, and fully functional to some degree even. I'm not really a fan of much slimmer devices nowadays, as aside from being usually bland in design, in durability they tend to be fragile. Well they're convenient to fit in a lot of spaces so I'll give them that, but bulkier devices are more hot and has more personality with them--obviously they tend to be more durable too.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the modern devices, for instance the Andri*d smartphones, comes in lots of flavors, it doesn't hold a candle compared to the variations available in the past--the designs and applications are absurd, the creativity was skyrocketing like bananas. There's a huge range when it comes to the layout of the buttons and screens, shape and size, and the number of peripherals and accessories they can handle. It revolutionized the trends and the internet culture even to this day.

                This phenomena wasn't only limited to the tangible side of technology, but to software as well. You got a vast array of plugins for your music players, with all these cool and questionable visuals to pick from. Wallpapers that are glossy and explores themes that breaks the barrier between reality and the cyberworld, they were really vibrant, filled with life and hopes for what comes to the future of technology. The creation was only bounded with everyone's imagination and time, and we were robbed of its time too soon.

                I grew up with an original PSP with UMD support and a bootleg GBA SP which games, if I recall correctly, contains flashed "160000" ROMs. Insane right? I was oblivious at the time on why the Gameboy was painfully slow at boot and at certain times, and why it has this library of unnecessary copies of the same group of games. Young me was trying to complete Crash Bandicoot XS and N-Tranced with all that gems and time attacks, but I never did. There's also Digimon Battle Spirit 2, Egg Mania, Kurukuru Kururin, a robot-building/fighting game, and a LOTR turn-based RPG, games that I spent hours only to not really beat them.
            </p>

                Our chunky old PC came with Windows XP installed, and bundled with Virtua Cop 2, Bejeweled 2, Zuma Deluxe, Need for Speed Underground 2, and some Game House Collection. By some, unfortunately not all games can run in our PC. In weekends, we'll go to our cousin and play with their PC, notably because they are connected to the internet. Cartoon Network, Y8, and Friv were our favorite spots in the web, and I'm not sure whether we played Kizi at the time, but I do remember visiting their site too at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course we didn't only spent our time with games, as quite diligent pupils we were once, we also tend to open and browse this cool program by Microsoft called Encarta Kids 2008, and I'm telling you that this is one of the only things I like about that company aside from Windows XP and 7, and yes, even their (formerly) Nokia Lumia.
            </p>
            <p>
                As much as I hated being in school and taking their boring curriculum, the learning materials through from these programs didn't bored me to death at all! I really felt like a student than a capitalist slave trainee for the future. Dinosaurs, human anatomy, origin of halloween, various art movements, history of film, parts of a bicycle, animal behaviours and habitats, everything's in it! Well almost everything to be exact, and it was outdated when it comes to information as again, we had no internet connection at the time. Not to mention they also come with a dictionary and a rather advanced scientific calculator which came pretty handy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aside from all of these, we also used to play our PSP 3000 a lot. Our game library has Lego Batman (iirc the name), Bliss Island, Ben 10 Protector of Earth, Dragon Ball Z Shin Budokai Another Road, and Invizimals: Shadow Zone, my <em>bias</em> from all of them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The game really captured me when I saw the clean, glossy and vibrant renders of the monsters on the UMD cover. I was entranced with the in-game visuals and UI, the visual and sound design (particularly with the Invizimals Catalog), and most importantly, the 3d models of the Invizimals. There is so much data for my brain to input into a messy information soup. God this game was a blessing especially considering the limitations of hardware at the time, the team behind it managed to push its limits, and take advantage of the AR technology. I was really bummed out when no one in our area knows what Invizimals is, as you would've guessed, Pokemon took over the world. Don't get me wrong, I love Pokemon too and mostly around the GBA releases (and currently adding the MOBA Pokemon UNITE), but it would be awesome to have Invizimals to be as relevant, popular, and one of its competitors in the genre and market. Anyways that's all for now about Invizimals, Shadow Zone specifically, as I'll save more details for the shrine. Overall, I love Invizimals and I'd like to see what it could have been in these days.
            </p>
            <p>
                Given with the absurd prices of the hardware, I decided to not invest yet to them considering the necessities I need to live everyday. So in order to have new experiences with these relics, I have the emulation on my side. With it I also got to try other titles that I've never been into before. I get to read more information about these games on their wikis, forums, and even in the social media that I never got to bother doing back then. Due to circumstances, I no longer possess my original copies of my games, and so emulation is the solution I decided to go with, plus, it works even better on my hardware performance-wise (minus the lack of peripherals or intended controllers/accessories). With it and these amazing communities that keep these titles alive, my connection on the games lives to this day.
            </p>
            <p>
                So yeah, the major contributing factors to why I love the old web, tech, and media is because of these things I had in my life. They really shaped me to creative endeavors and pursuit.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a momentarily end of reminiscing the good things we had in the past. It doesn't necessarily mean that I have to let go of them just to move forward when I can walk with them in the process. Discarding them meant the gradual disappearance of what I am as today. I don't like the old things because I want to live with those times and be myself in the past, rather, I want to walk alongside with them into the future with who I am today and will ever be.

            <h3>Re; Purpose</h3>
            <p>
                And so with all these fiasco, I decided to ditch Windows 10 and switch to Linux Mint completely. It was a pain to setup due to display and audio driver issues, as well as boot up problems, but after several attempts of reviving my laptop I managed to make it stable and fully functional as intended. Unlike from my previous attempts, this I would say the <em>'final stable'</em> installation I have so far. I'll write a separate blog on the horrors I encountered when dealing with this OS, anyways, moving on.
            </p>
            <p>
                I tested Aseprite, the binary that I bought from their Humble Bundle, and there were only brief lags when moving and zooming the canvas, as for stroking the brush it goes smoothly as it can. I really hated the Steam release due to how unusable it is even with the compatibility layer it offers. As much as I needed to switch my setup, I still want to hold on with my laptop and get the most out of it given the limitations--I want to preserve it. I'll assemble a new setup sooner or later as I need to renovate my workspace.
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking of software, my Aseprite works well, and I got both stable VSCodium and Librewolf which works blazingly fast, which could imply that I <em>properly</em> partitioned my SSD this time. Given these, I'm pretty much glad with my current setup--Mint is clean, simple, and customizable to an extent (I'm using XFCE).
            </p>
            <p>
                Tech stuff aside, I also managed to track my habits, to-do's, and moods. Albeit I haven't tracked my sleeping behavior yet. My thoughts about it is that it's kinda neat to have this database you can peek into and see notes of what you did and feeling on that day. You get to reflect at some points, and probably be able to make better decisions at the present. Anyways, I'm taking care of myself, and that's a huge step for me--I was able to see my worth beyond art, beyond my body, beyond the numbers I'm making online and in reality. That's why I'm really thankful to these software (although it would be cool for the DailyBean to work offline), I'm able to record my progress. You see, my brain cannot retain too much information, not even crystal clear, regarding my experiences, as I got used to repressing my emotions and memories from the past (this would be a topic to a different time), so these apps really saved me on keeping a journal.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'd like to get back on my journal and blog entries someday, look back at my writings from my experiences, and laugh at it. Think about how far I've come. How it was this simple all this time. That I'm still learning a lot of things despite of my age. That I'm perfect as being the imperfect being I am. That I grew. That I became a proper adult. That I managed to live a fulfilling life to the end. That I'll be satisfied even after death. That this is the Din that once lived to this generation, era, and the very fabric of reality.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're reading this 20 years from now, Din, I just have a question for you.
            </p><br>
            <p style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0;">
                "How are you, and the things going on right now?"
            </p><br>
            <p>
                I know that you can do it. Keep coming up whenever you see yourself down in the mud. Keep moving on under the heavy rains. No strong winds will ever send you away far from these lands. Just keep on getting up.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alright, that's enough for the cringe bits. Regardless of the journals and habit tracking apps, it won't do anything if I don't do my part. Being depressed and miserable is okay, but staying as is isn't. If I want changes to happen I have to start from myself, I'm the one that will make things possible and happen. This is the sole purpose of my webpages and partaking in the web revival movement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything starts now.
            </p>

            <h3>End; Start</h3>
            <p>
                I'm going to be actively working on both art and web dev, and eventually be back on game dev as well. That's how I'd like to live my life starting this day. It would be a tough road as there's a lot of obstacles in the way, but those won't matter.

            <p>I'm tired but I really need to finish this this day--I know that I can. Right now I'm adding the lowpoly models I worked on. However, it won't be done right away as even if I already have my GIFs for them, they unoptimized, and I don't want that. I'll work on them one by one, starting from their raw text file (for picoCAD) into exporting them as GIFs. I have my backup of files to my local storage but I'll still double check everything just in case. UGH! So much to do!!</p>

            <p>I updated a lot of stuff to my stuff to my website, archived some sites, and started playing Pokemon TCG Pocket. Most of the changes on the website would likely to be not visible at all, still.</p>

            <p>Regardless, now it has Resources and Commissions pages. The microblog window/section was also added to homepage. CSS have been refactored/updated in some areas (I've been thinking of turning it into a entire framework, but eh).</p>
            
            <p>Resources contains all links, credits, and archived pages I have. This is simply a bookmarks and resource dump overall--all for the sake of preservation. I worked a lot on the CSS side so the content is a bit short for now, and it will still take more time to put all my bookmarks and resources there. Speaking of CSS, thanks to its own style I managed to update Gallery and Commissions pages' styles as well.</p>

            <p>I also started playing Pokemon TCG Pocket and it's really fun! Currently I have MewTwo ex, Charizard ex, full art foil Porygon, and other promo art cards. What captivated me is how they nailed the rendering of the cards, it was simply amazing! The depth of the effects really free its limiting canvas to reach the artwork's full potential! I think most artists who worked on these cards were happy to see the 3d effects (or not, if for some reasons). Nevertheless it was really a fun game and I want to get more beautiful cards (to obsess and look at hours) in the future.</p>

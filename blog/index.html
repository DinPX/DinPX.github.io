                <h1 id="In Lieu of the Ghiblification">In Lieu of the Ghiblification</h1>

                <p><em>We become part of it, even just for a mere moment.</em></p>

                <p class="divider">‚îà‚îà„Éª‡≠® ‚ú¶ ‡≠ß„Éª‚îà‚îà</p>

                <p>Everyone is jumping on the hype train which is the <em>'Ghiblifying'</em> generative AI. They are simply having fun without fully knowing the impact of these to the artists and the industry. They generate images for their loved ones, for making memes, and even as a gift for their partners. They mean no harm at all but regardless damages have been made.</p>

                <p>Anyone could've commissioned artists which are capable of doing this style but since social media is notorious for driving trends to everyone, and that it is an ongoing trend, no one would like to miss this opportunity, as it is a content they can fill in with their social media accounts for everyone to see and marvel at, and so they jumped right in and used the app instead. Just with a couple of text prompts and a single hit of a button they can get their <em>'Ghiblified'</em> selves. It's simple for them. There's no need to wait for days or months for a piece to be done and delivered to their mail (or door). Just a single click of a button is all the push they need at the end.</p>

                <p>"Wow this is just like [insert well-known Ghibli film here]? Isn't it so lovely?" Too bad people tend to like art while giving less or no care at all to those who create them. I wish artists get more of the recognition and respect they deserve. There are literally people who suffer from health issues and yet persevere just to deliver their pieces on time, just so that everyone can see their latest work. Animators spent years studying and honing their crafts just so we kept entertained and possibly have reflections and insights on life itself.</p>

                <p>Then, these days we have generators that spit out abominations that can't be discerned by the common eye and everyone's be like "Yes! Anyone can do art now!", "Oh, this is great especially for people who have disabilities", "Pen and papers aren't that accessible" and so on when history and present proved otherwise. These arguments meant nothing but excuses. Cave painting is a thing, and for me prehistoric humans who did them have more personality than those who isn't willing to learn paint. Hell, even petroglyphs exists depicting anthropomorphic silhouettes. People with disabilities are also capable of making beautiful artwork e.g. even incapacitated, they draw and paint with their feet or mouth. There are even VTubers that despite their conditions, they're able to stream for everyone, have fundraising to support the cause, and inspire people. These people who are fully functional, mostly in stable conditions, aren't willing to learn how to make art nor even pay genuine artists and it's sickening.</p>

                <p>Art is life as parts of ourselves are in it, it's an experience and reflections of ourselves, and yet it is desecrated everyday, may it be unknowingly or voluntarily, by the same people who see the beauty in it. <strong>They only want to pluck the flower, not to tend on it.</strong></p>

                <p>Not to even try to understand it. Not at all.</p>

                <p>I remember my 'first' drawing was that of Spider-Man cartoon I watched TV when I was in kindergarten. I used a gel pen which my father used for flooring plans and other plates. It wasn't filled with color but it was cool nonetheless. I made it. I made Spider-Man appear on that notebook page. I was happy with the result albeit I'll admit that I'm too picky with my drawings back then and wasted a lot of papers as a result. Nevertheless, it was a journey of my traditional artworks. I played with a lot of crayons, I hated oil pastels, I liked watercolors a bit, coloring pencils are godsend, and so on. I even made numerous comics and manga but unfortunately most of them were engulfed with the same fire that reduced our old home to ashes. Despite all of this, it is undeniable that even if my older works are no longer here with us, I'm a living proof that with enough time to stubbornly draw despite being a huge idiot like me, anyone can learn to love and create art. Okay I could've worded that properly but you get what I meant.</p>

                <p>Even with all of my yapping, it isn't a question of whether they'd like to learn or not, as most of these users prompt for the sake of getting an artwork instantly, not learning how to make them in days. Frankly, I don't see how they'll be convinced to get an artist to draw for them instead, as I've mentioned, with just a click they can get what they want, which most of the time looks just good to their eyes. Unlike us artists, we have trained our eyes that we can spot certain suspicious details which the average person can't. There are countless posts in X in which it took numerous people to point out such details, as the original posters seemed to have missed them before posting.</p>

                <p>Frankly, from how I'm seeing it, there's no way of preventing these people from using genAI. It will keep on going as long as it's accessible to pretty much everyone. The only thing that could stop this, possibly, is that if these prompts keep burning funds from their server maintenance and computation costs. Also, if the administration regulates its usage there would be a chance that copyrighted works would no longer be used for prompts (but, come on, we're talking about them and these companies).</p>

                <p>Technology over the years have drastically improved and made our lives easier (don't count the current GPUs and shit). Washing machines made it a breeze to do laundry. Air conditioners made it possible to have a cool, humid room anywhere. Ballpens literally remained to this day, that's just how irreplaceable its design is. Yet some people defend that this 'tech' will save everyone as it replaces the labor with the accessibility, like, what the fuck. Are you even hearing yourself? It literally robs everyone of opportunity to have their dream jobs just because idiots keep on supporting these companies on this push.</p>

                <p>Anyone can draw a gummy worm or a cute caterpillar with just a bunch of circles. Fuck. A gummy bear can be drawn with just a bunch of 6's and 9's that I learned since elementary. You can't give me an excuse that you can't draw when you used to be a kid, just like everyone else, and have made a sketch or 2 in your entire life.</p>

                <p>Yeah perhaps (most likely even) that those interests were far too long gone for you to even care, but maybe if you just tried to make a simple sketch and show it to your loved ones maybe you'll find that curiosity to learn again. That small fire to push those hands on bringing life with a mere ink.</p>

                <p>In place of Ghiblification, and if you really liked their art and even their films in the slightest, look behind the scenes of their entire works. Keep in mind that in those years, these animators kept pushing their careers with sheer will and dedication. Fuck bad posture and lack of sleep, here's a fucking masterpiece to have something to learn from on in regards to life itself. Maybe, just maybe, if you see what they've gone through you'll symphathize with artists and even try to pick up a goddamn drawing app on Playstore.</p>

                <p>Just another point in history when art is deeply revered and loved while artists are hated to the core. Classic.</p>

                <h1 id="One's Truth, Once Lie">One's Truth, Once Lie</h1>
                <p><em>We can only form our own truth based from the experiences we had and views we made along the way. Which is why isolating oneself from having interactions on the outside world, and forming meaningful relationships in the process, would make one's truth more fragile and utterly narrow from anyone.</em></p>

                <p class="divider">‚îà‚îà„Éª‡≠® ‚ú¶ ‡≠ß„Éª‚îà‚îà</p>
    
                <details><summary>Click to show/hide content</summary>
                    <p>What we see is just a miniscule portion of what the world and life offers. To fully realize oneself is to formulate one's ultimate, absolute truth. The only truth in which others' cannot be possibly compare and overcome of. Humanity hasn't perished yet as the truth of goodness in humanity prevails. Humans have ever been so good from the start, only being corrupted through their years, but still they chose to help each other rise and build a better future for the next generations to come.</p>

                    <p>I was convinced that the truth can only be that there is only an endless violence to this world. People will resort to raising their voices and fists to those who oppose their ideals and goals. But despite of all of these, there are people who spend their time, 24/7, nursing the weak and vulnerable. There are people who bloodied their hands to maintain the order and peace within their nation against foreign threats. Regardless of the means, being all flawful, most people do their best, do whatever they can, to save a single life and another. My truth used to focus on the cruelty of humanity, when I failed to see the other side, or rather I willingly turned blind from it.</p>

                    <p>The truth is even with all these problems in life, in the end, humans value meaningful relationships and each other's lives. That's why we're still here, breathing, taking action in the present, and looking forward for tomorrow.</p>

                    <p>I once found myself in a critical condition where I can't walk properly anymore, and mentally I just want everything to end. I desperately ignored whatever the guardians and patients were offering at the time, but thinking about it, they were just worried about me. I don't have anyone on my room except me and my essential needs. Everyone helped me to recover and if it wasn't for them I wouldn't be here today.</p>

                    <p>I used to think that my past, that every connection and relationships I had were meaningless. That they bore nothing out of everything. But because of all the pain and warmth we all shared we reached this point in time. I'm in no good condition compared to them but I'm still glad that they all happened. I had a good run with them despite everything. Which is why I can say that I won't allow anyone to insult my life, as it contains my moments with everyone. Not single one can deny a truth that I had important people once in my life.</p>

                    <p>To think that I value myself so little I was convinced that no one loved me. That's wrong. I was simply running away, and was afraid of having anyone fully accept me for what I am. Looking back at it, I only chose the memories in which comforts my fear of one's worth rejection, but I was wrong. The truth is that I was loved, that I was a dear friend on those moments. I was afraid of everything that I pushed everyone away. I don't deserve anyone's love.</p>

                    <p>Even in this state I won't deny everything that happened in my life, I won't reject any meaningful relationships I had. That is a truth of mine.</p>

                    <p>I'll give my everything, my best to this day and the next ones to come. I'll work on my truth.</p>

                <p><em>I think what brings the worst of us is that we constantly walk towards the brief pleasure of being alive, and so death is a gentle, eternal reminder for us to do better.</em></p>
    
                <p>This is a rant for whatever wrong is going on with the world which most people actively dismiss solely to live a brief comfort moment and not yearn (fight off even) for a much better, not dehumanizing society. If you like how things work that violence, slavery, and other degeneracy is allowed in plain sight, and that the next generation should be working under inhumane conditions, perpetually turning the cogs, and doesn't deserve a promising future, please, do yourself a favor and turn into fertilizer 6ft deep underground. Thank you.</p>

                    <p>Personally, given all the problems we have in this world, I think even in the amidst of the possibility that someday higher extraterrestrail beings will try to conquer us, or kaijus will rise up from the depths of the sea and decimating half of the entire populace, we as human beings will still find opportunities from dire situations to profit from them. Death is profitable. Injuries can cost an arm and leg. And we're just that stupid. Even if some monster shows up and started blasting people, we'll argue whether the monsters' actions are immoral, woke, religious or political. It's insane how sensitive and active we are when it comes to one's ideologies and actions, but never been too responsible to make the right choices for everyone.</p>

                    <p>Despite the limitations of the technology in the early years, development teams were able to be creative enough and push the limits of hardware to their untapped potential. Palette swaps were applied to deliver more colors to various levels and sprites; 4 channels (usually) and sometimes an extra for samples were used to make rather complex background musics; raycasting to present 2d graphics in a pseudo 3d render; <i>.kkrieger</i> created by <i>.theprodukkt</i>, is an FPS game that fits in 96kb size; fogs were used in the PS1 Silent Hill to hide distant objects being loaded; some sprites in NES Kirby's Dream Land are cut into 2 to save space and allow reusability; and so much more.</p>
    
                    <p>Prior to the current state of AAA games, titles shipped were finished and are in a playable state. Now, large studios focus on creating games that are colossal in size, too buggy in release, filled with 'micro' transactions, mostly are live service, doesn't have any single player or local coop mode, and so much more. It's embarassing given how technologically advance we are now but we got these incompetent releases. The old media storage then weren't as impressive as to what we use now, and so devs have to be creative enough in order to make games fully work, with less to no bugs noticeable in release, whilst working under very limiting conditions, and they made it possible (looking at you, my beloved DOOM, PSP, and GBA games). Nowadays it's just a race to ship a barely working unoptimized game with uninteresting elements.</p>

                    <p>I'm not only putting the blame to the corpo, but also the corpo shills and the consumers who don't even bother questioning their gods (corpo, derogatory) anymore. Part of my pet peeves are the individuals who do have access to information in regards to how greedy and scummy a huge studio or publisher is given their practices and history, and yet keep on supporting them by flushing their bucks. The same can be said on crypto investors given the countless rugpulls these 2 years. Instead of complaining why games are dead nowadays, stop buying those uninspiring AAA garbage, let go of those titles since they've been <i>Frankenstein-ed</i> since the IP acquisition, and buy actual games from well-known or rising indie devs. Perhaps, just a big IF, if no attention and pocket were given to these clueless executives, they'll turn a new leaf and be a bit kind towards their teams and the players alike.</p>

Anyways, in Trumpet's recent inauguration, he purposefully made the salute of a certain notorious figure in history. This is a huge red flag and he sure knows what he's doing. Taking on the X platform was a mistake, and with him leading it, the misinformation will rise, hate will spread, and more people will unfortunately worship him, Trumpet, and anything in their circle. Surely he's aware of how he's portrayed and ridiculed by people who isn't buying his lies, and so most of his actions are driven out of spite and solely to feed his ego in my opinion--that's what fulfills his purpose and very being.</p>
                    
                    <p>Recently, speaking of his image, he was accused of boosting (having someone to 'pilot') his account in Path of Exile 2 over his poorly played stream, which experienced players quickly caught on to. Look, I don't play the game and so I have no idea how all of its mechanics and meta work, but what I do no is to never trust his deceptive character given the years he had built his image. Given the aforementioned, this is just one of their days of casually lying about their reputation and so it won't be a surprise that the platform will be used for their advantage to their agendas--take what happened to Asmongold's X account for example, which by the way I don't watch nor a fan of him either.</p>

They reinforce misinformation and illiteracy, absurd standards and expectations (e.g. empowering unnecessary overspending, devaluing relationships, toxic masculinity, dehumanization regardless of sex and race, etc.), and other degeneracy because they cannot handle an honest life, they can't have genuine connections, and they only know to live the day for merely clicks and recognition.</p>

                    <p>Remember that Mr. Beast's target audience comprises of minors, even to the likes of Logan and KSI, and so they pose a danger to the young audience by promoting and marketing unhealthy products. They can take advantage of younger people as they can't give criticisms not only towards the products but to the grifters themselves as well. Their audience aren't as knowledgeable when it comes to legalities and aren't that familiar with Mr. Beast and co.'s history, which is why they can always just get away with these practices.</p>
    
                    <p>Overall, I'm frustrated with how irresponsible the people in power are. We let these kind of insufferable idiots to rule us for years with no positive drastic changes whatsoever making it norm for dehumanizing perception, labor, and treatment. I want people to realize that their voice matters, that they are capable of making a positive impact as long as they don't let these creeps get a hold of their critical thinking, decisions, and life--i.e. don't give them the attention and power. One can be that gear to make the machine collapse for something new and better.</p>
    
                    <p>I won't expect much to the people changing their votes on the upcoming election given how many corrupt and unqualified officials have been elected in my country. People just care about how famous and rich politicians here are even if they're uneducated to the position they're aiming for. A lot of actors have gotten their way into the administration, as well as people who have no background whatsoever in law. If people speak up for the truth, regardless if they're journalists, election candidates, or civilians, they'll go missing on the spot or end up with bullet shots. I hate people with power and I truly hope they suffer, e.g. getting incurable diseases for they fuck up the healthcare and research so bad so they got a hell taste of it.</p>
    
                    <p>Why do even people kept falling under these kind of people? They haven't learned a single lesson from previous presidential terms. They rather have the brief gratification for having their votes bought, rather than yearn for a prosperous stable life in a long term under the leadership of a promising leader. I'm sick of it. Frankly, at this point, I don't buy the excuse that they're in-need of financial support which is why they sold their votes, when people tend lean to their egos regarding their beliefs. This is prominent given the lines of <em>"We won! Cry over it. You lost the election.", "I told you so, I'm right! We won this election."</em>, and so on. No you mentally challenged fuck, you didn't won anything, and this isn't even about winning or losing in the first place. This is about being a responsible adult, not repeating the cycle, and providing a better place to the next generation just so they won't end up like us. You fucking disgust me.</p>
                    
                    <p>I don't even care if it ended friendships at some point, for me it is understandable especially when they have this toxic mindset on politics. They're treating it as a game, and protecting their egos and images in their circle in exchange for a dehumanizing ruling of parasites. They only think about themselves, not the betterment of the whole. Period.</p>
    
                    <p>If you're alright with having a CEO tell you that you should be comfortable of not owning your games, having a president back when they have criminal records, and others that are just questionable, you should get your brain checked for any possible damage.</p>
    
                    <p>In today's era, people are willing to go lengths as long as they get the recognition and numbers that grow their social media presence. Not a single care for any repercussions, and much worse, their actions are even encouraged by the same unhinged and chronically online users. The misuse of the social media and internet as a whole led us to this. Even with the advances in our civilization, we're far from being civilized--my own sanity is dwindling and I'm becoming more uncivil with my wishes for the corrupt. It is my fault for being human and having my fuse run out.</p>

                    <p>Back on 2023, multiple Israeli TikToks have gained attention for being infamous on mocking Palestinian victims on genocide. They're so sickening that not only they're willing to made fun of the deaths of innocent people that died or have suffered from losses, injuries, and hunger, but also happy to go such lengths that they'll include their kids to their garbage videos. They don't deserve their life, they don't deserve to have kids, and most importantly, they don't deserve to live. In my opinion, if you insult and view someone's life as insignificant and worthless, you deserve to be treated the same way, as disregarding human empathy is the same as insulting humanity and life itself. You don't deserve to be treated as a human if you make fun of other's suffering, take advantage over their bodily autonomy, make other's life more miserable deliberately, and other forms of degeneracy. You don't deserve anything that is humane.</p>

                    <p>They have no idea what it feels like to lose a home, to have nothing to return to. I thought when I was a kid that it'll never happen, that these stupid telenovelas are being stale for the same arson-related conflicts. In a moment, our first house was engulfed in flames and my beloved books, drawings, and other things went with it. I almost lost my family. I was like an hour or 2 still processing what just happened, and I no longer recall what my friends asked me on that midnight. Everything was slow and I can only feel the loss and pain at the time. I am very confused what's gonna happen from that point. Everything we had just robbed away in an instant by some cosmic fluke. I fucking hated that fire, why of all things that could happen it did and even chose us?</p>
    
                    <p>Fortunately we have a relative nearby, and so we settled temporarily there. The next morning came and we were asked by our friends again on like how we were doing, what happened during that midnight, or what's going to happen on us siblings from that moment onwards. I simply don't know. I'm a kid, and things just happened too fast. I don't know.</p>
    
                    <p>If I remember correctly it was around my 5th grade when the fire happened. Regardless, fast forward to this day, I hold much dislike to people who cheats, takes advantage of people, etc., and by now as writing this I realize what partially causes it. Just don't ever make fun of others suffering, and don't even bother turning it into a 'fun content'. If you do, you deserve to suffer and die. There's a difference to a sarcastic dark humor vs straight up mockery filled with contempt. Fuck Nas Daily, fuck Mr. Beast, and fuck Loner Musk.</p>

                    <p>Most people fail to see why this is a problem unless it's too late and the same horrible things happen to them. Why wait for these to come when we have the means to prevent them from ever happening? These inhumane individuals are also the ones that tend to defend themselves as the victims, and so it is just and righteous to inflict the same pain they had towards the others, which is just an excuse for them to commit killings for pleasure and wealth. News outlets aren't so reliable either for labeling these gruesome events as war instead of genocide. Journalists here in the west don't even try when it comes to properly addressing the numbers of victims and deaths in the headlines, labeling the them instead as casualties and injuries. Not upholding to your integrity in journalism just nullifies your authenticity and profession. You might as well just use your talent on the likes of IGN, they'll surely benefit from you.</p>
    
                    <p>A lot of individuals just seem to lean more in favor of violence and hatred. For instance, aside from the aforementioned mockery of genocide via Israeli Tiktok slops, we have some imageboards and the defunct Liveleak containing uncensored posts of horrific events that shows a death of a person. Now, personally I don't find any problems having those kind of content circling around the internet, especially if they're uncensored as news outlets can source them for legitimacy and accuracy of the events. However, my problem with these contents is that people make fun of the victims, and being 'edgy' in the process. Also the problematic shocker sites doesn't do anything other than devaluing human's lives by turning them into basically jumpscares, which is just straight out disrespectful. By constantly consuming these gorey content, mocking the poor individuals behind it, they're gradually getting desensitized of humanity and basic empathy.</p>
    
                    <p>Internet, social media, imageboards, forums, all of it weren't a mistake, but the misuse of these technology is. Schools particulary the elementary level should always have subjects about computers and proper netiquette, in order to lead the next generation as responsible surfers of the internet, and make them literate enough to manage their own computer, operating systems, antivirus measures, and so on. In short, teaching the proper use of the technology we have will be a good shift to prevent these kind of problems in the social media and cyberspace as a whole. We are at the age that computers play a vital role to the society's growth, i.e. for the circulation of information, communication, and needs, and so we have to let the younger users be prepared and responsible with its usage--so that again, they won't end up like the most of us.</p>
    
                    <p>If most people can be good at using a computer and browsing the internet, and is literate to discern the information they digest from the web space, these acts alone can contribute on combatting against the spread of misinformation, hate speech, and more. It will prevent most pseudoscience, beliefs and alike that can endanger people's lives. It can save mental health and even lives themselves. (Of course, remember to make some Vitamin D outside. Get some grass.)</p>

Prices keep skyrocketing, increased wages aren't enough, ghosts are real in terms of vacant roles, HR demands for the non-existent candidate which makes it impossible for fresh graduates to enter after enduring 10 or more rounds of interviews (i.e. they're only open for seniors), college doesn't guarantee/secures a job in specific fields, demand for AI goes up which advances layoffs of humans who need the job, and much more it's dehumanizing that to the rich,we're mere expendable workforce and not humans who need to live at all.</p>
    
                    <p>The poor and middle class, and marginalized as a whole will continue to be discarded from proper living as long as the rich have power and influence over journalism, academia, products, laws, and pretty much everything. They need to die--the possibility of being this absurdly powerful should die.</p>

                    <p>The rich can go with a slap on the wrist by committing tax evasion via existing loopholes, while people who steal bread and medicine just to live another day gets to be shamed by society and spend months or years in behind bars. Remind you, multimillionaires get to steal billions of money from the working class and just get away from it, while the poor gets to suffer even more for committing crimes that just to meet their needs. It doesn't make any sense and I genuinely believe that the rich should be fed to maggots, alive.</p>

                    <p>There's much wrong in this world and most of us still go to X and press about petty issues when there are more important matters. Fuck your Tuesdays drama when people are literally dying every day from hunger, diseases, untreated injuries, human trafficking, and so on. I don't care what gender or identity you are in, I'm fucking agender and I don't go around yelling about it or being sensitive about having my pronouns addressed incorrectly. For fuck sake be a sane individual and address legitimate problems instead of being this hypersensitive obnoxious petty fuck on the internet. And you know what? Fuck your beliefs if you think addressing you correctly matters more than the victims of the corrupt system. I'm saying this as there's no problem with genders (aside from MAPs they can die off a cliff for even considering it, and also zoophiles should die too), in fact thanks to it I get to know more about my identity as I'm unfamiliar with terms and how I'll catergorize myself, and this applies to a lot of us, however, what I find problematic are these crybabies who kept being online whining about how they're being victims when they're the ones in the wrong, and will even dare to escalate things even further.</p>
    
                    <p>Don't go around acting assholes on public which then if confronted about your actions you'll play the victim and spread lies about being harassed. People are correcting your behaviors on public as not only they're intolerable and annoying, they disrupt the peace of the everyone whether they're working or just enjoying their morning coffee. Again, regardless of your gender, race, or background, this doesn't give you the pass to be a complete asshole to everyone. You're not special (but in a way, yes) and you should be civil. Period.</p>
    
                    <p>Unfortunately with your actions, some individuals get to be lumped to your image. Instead of having a positive light to these communities your only turning it more favorable towards the sexist and racist fucks. Again, just act civilized both in public and even in the internet.</p>
    
                    <p>Our identities and traumas shouldn't be treated as means to be above and just anyone else. We're just as humans as everybody else (excecpt for people who enjoy pointless war, rape, and other degenerate acts against humanity) and so we should act just as how we want others to perceive and treat us back. Make communities thrive instead of dividing us further from each other.</p>
    
                    <p>Ugh. I should just write a separate blog about this as it's rather deep and complicated to fit in this section.</p>
    
                    <p>Oh by the way, if you're a minor and is voluntarily going to NSFW accounts which explicitly states something like <em>'DNI with minors'</em>,and is harassing these creators for posting NSFW content to the point that they can't work and have thoughts on not only deactivvating their accounts but killing themselves completely, please kindly fuck off the internet and do your fucking home work and chores you insufferable fuck. We've all been on your age before, but not to a degree that we'll go on our way just to harass people to death. Do better with your time and spend it wisely while you can. Get off the internet and stop chugging those vile Prime slops.</p>
    
                    <p>Again, stop going to spaces that aren't for your ages just to call them out for doing their job which are targetted towards their intended audience, and not you. God. Is it so difficult to do? To understand? Fuck. I know you're doing this not just because of clicks and attention, but mostly because you don't have anything better to do with your life. </p>

                    <p>I'm ending this with that I have no expectations for humans to do any better. I know some people do, but I have no hopes for the most of humanity. With the ongoing focus on military funds, confidentials funds or whatever the fuck isn't disclosed to the public, I doubt that everything will get better here or anywhere in a larger picture.</p>
    
                    <p>Abuses will continue, the ozone layer will become thinner, few species will be extinct, rich will only get richer, X's echo chamber will only grow, news outlets will continue to lie, healthcare costs will stack, and people will still kill each other.</p>
    
                    <p>I won't kill myself and will continue to fight under these oppresive system. I'll continue to live my life as I see fit even with these circumstances, just as how I made it this far.</p>

                    <h1 id="Kunai Kitten v0.1.8.2 - My Thoughts and Process">My Thoughts and Process</h1>
    
                    <p>Originally titled in my head and folder Knives n' Kitten, my ideas for the game now titled Kunai Kitten, have been changed into a more workable scope to make it work and complete it.</p>
    
                    <p>After a while I managed to complete a game, i.e. most elements I want to include made it to the release. There's a working main menu, score, game over, credits, and help screens, as well as a very simple boss fight, dialogue system, and even a super/skill. Bonus is that only a single spacebar controls all of it.</p>
    
                    <p>The game itself was far from what I originally planned. It's supposed to be a roguelike with cards/scrolls that can buff or nerf the player based on their contract details, solely to follow the agreement theme in this jam. The story was also cut down into incoherent parts and were far from what I originally intended. Due to skill issue I threw these ideas to the garbage bin (for now).</p>
    
                    <p>Here are some of the original notes I have in PasteBin: <a href="https://pastebin.com/A6LiuCSv" target="_blank">https://pastebin.com/A6LiuCSv</a></p>
    
                    <p>Trust me, I know the plot given there is generic but I had a plot twist in mind :></p>
    
                    <p>Anyways, because of these I made it simpler and aimed for the bug theme instead. My take to the theme is simple and literal: enemies are bugs. It's plain but it works for me given the constraints and lack of other ideas.</p>
    
                    <p>I just recycled my core game mechanic/loop from my previous work Orbit Block. Additionally, I reinvented the wheel due to losing my original source code from that project (and that I want to figure it out from scratch). It's important for me to finish the main core mechanic as there's no game if there's only a menu.</p>
    
                    <p>After the main game loop was done I worked on the rest: combo system, super/skill, score system, dialogue system, game over, and all of the menus respectively.</p>

                    <p>So uhhhh we need to get everything working on a single button, yeah? Well, not actually because when I double-checked the guidelines it's just optional. Still, my stubborn brain decided to go anyways because at the time I'm having an art block (it makes sense, trust me).</p>

                    <p>The aim rotates on its own and the player can change its directions-all solely for the purpose of using 1 button only when shooting enemies.</p>

                    <p>I want a rotating guide line to help the player aim on the enemies, and have its direction change whenever the spacebar is being pressed. It also attacks at press and therefore allows the player to rapidly tap the key to make the aim a bit more precise.</p>

                    <p>With that the setup for aim guide and attack projectiles are mostly done.</p>

                    <p>And so I setup the enemies. They're just your generic <em>Sprite</em> with an <em>Area2D</em> child that detects the bullets. The Sprite2D bullets also have <em>monitorable</em> Area2D child. The function that runs on signal only checks for which <em>collision_mask</em> the Area2Ds belong to, so that they are independent from checking names of the <em>Nodes</em> which can be complicated and uncertain.</p>

                    <p>The enemies also have their own AimLine and Pointer but targeted towards the player only. Yes I know I could've just used their own global_position and player's but it didn't occured to me at the time. Additionally, I thought this was more convenient due to the familiar Node structure, and I know where they're aiming at thru the Editor just like the player.</p>

                    <p>Then the bugs learned to shoot as well, added their <a href="https://godotshaders.com/shader/hit-flash-effect-shader/" target="_blank">hit flash shader made by triangledevv</a>, and handled the damage system on both sides. After that I worked on one of my favorite parts: the UI.</p>

                    <h2 id="Kunai Kitten v0.1.8.2 - The HUD System">The HUD System</h2>

                    <p>When I had the idea for the protagonist's character design, I thought that it would be cool for their scarf to be represented as the health bar in their HP HUD.</p>

                    <h3 id="Kunai Kitten v0.1.8.2 - The Stylized HP Bar">The Stylized HP Bar</h3>

                    <p>It's made up of <em>Control Nodes</em> and it breaks down into 2 main parts: the <em>Viewport "HP"</em> and <em>TextureRect "HPTexture"</em>.</p>

                    <img src="../src/img/works/gamedev/kunai_kitten_v0.1.8.2_ss_01.png">

                    <p>All Nodes in the Viewport are treated as a single <em>ViewportTexture</em>, which then the TextureRect uses. Now that we have a <em>single and whole</em> HP bar, we can add an outline shader, which in this case I used the <a href="https://godotshaders.com/shader/2d-outline-inline-configured-for-sprite-sheets/" target="_blank">2D outline /inline, configured for spritesheets by Juulpower</a>.</p>

                    <p>Since it treats HP's children Nodes as a whole texture, the outline includes the <em>CPUParticles2D "ShadowZone"</em> too.</p>

                    <p>Now for the actual elements that are being rendered; they are the <em>TextureProgress "Progress"</em> and <em>TextureRect "ScarfDecor"</em> Nodes. Because Progress is a TextureNode, I just made a stylized HP bar. The ScarfDecor is just the static scarf that overlays on the character's head here.</p>

                    <p>Under the ScarfDecor is a TextureRect "Avatar" node. It has an <em>AnimatedTexture</em> resource as its texture, that is then animated by an <em>AnimationPlayer</em> depending on the player's state (e.g. healing, or being hit by an attack).</p>

                    <p>And with all of that we now have a working, outlined and animated stylized HP bar for the main character. Yippee! Skibidi!</p>

                    <p>By the way, the boss bar UI follows almost the same structure as the HP HUD.</p>

                    <h3 id="Kunai Kitten v0.1.8.2 - The Score and Combo Counter">The Score and Combo Counter</h3>

                    <p>The score counter simply displays the score value in the <em>Global.gd Singleton (Autoload)</em>, and the same applies for combo as well. Both the score and combo displays are <em>RichTextLabels</em> so that I could style them via <em>BBCode</em> whenever I want.</p>

                    <p>Each 10th hit the combo text is styled with the <em>[rainbow]</em> tag, and then shows its <em>CPUParticles2D "Blitz"</em>.</p>

                    <p>That pretty much covers the UI for the actual gameplay itself. Now let's talk about the menus.</p>

                    <p class="divider">‚îà‚îà„Éª‡≠® ‚ú¶ ‡≠ß„Éª‚îà‚îà</p>

                    <h2 id="Kunai Kitten v0.1.8.2 - Scenes and Global Script"> Scenes and Global Script</h2>

                    <p>The  main menu, help, credits, game over screen, and gameplay <em>Scene</em> itself are navigated through the use of Global.gd Singleton. It handles the switch between all Scenes, as well as keeping and changing all persistent data.</p>

                    <p>Global.gd doesn't handle the background music, rather, each scenes have their own BGM and is set to autoplay.</p>

                    <h3 id="Kunai Kitten v0.1.8.2 - Main Menu">Main Menu</h3>

                    <p>The main menu itself doesn't have any buttons. In fact, it only relies on a <em>Timer</em> which increments a variable each its timeout signal, which then the number determines what RichTextLabel will be edited thru BBCode and animated by Tween.</p>

                <p>With that we don't have to work with buttons which can be a bit more complex (at least for me)--just trick the player into thinking that they're actually choosing and pressing a button.</p>

                <p>Making every thing as simple as possible is a must regardless if it's for a jam or not, it's more manageable that way obviously.</p>

                <p>Given all of these I covered pretty much most of the elements I want to function in this short project. However, we haven't talked about the dialogue system and the super/skill yet--so bear with me, we're almost done!</p>

                <p class="divider">‚îà‚îà„Éª‡≠® ‚ú¶ ‡≠ß„Éª‚îà‚îà</p>

                <h1 id="Kunai Kitten v0.1.8.2 - My Simple, Linear Dialogue System">My Simple, Linear Dialogue System</h2>

                <p>My dialogue system is linear and so it doesn't present any alternative route, and why is that? I wanted to make it simple so I only used a single animation in an AnimationPlayer to animate all of its scenes.</p>

                <p>But you might be thinking: <em>"well you could've just called some methods by frames and even add more animations"</em>, and yes you're right but I don't have really much time for this game alone and so I went again with a simpler solution.</p>

                <p>Don't get me wrong, I still called functions on specific frames, specifically the <em>stop_timeline()</em> and <em>stop_act()</em> methods.</p>

                <img src="../src/img/works/gamedev/kunai_kitten_v0.1.8.2_ss_02.png">

                <ul>
                    <li><b>stop_timeline()</b> literally stops the timeline and waits for another allowed spacebar input to continue the timeline once again</li>
                    <li><b>stop_act()</b> stops the 'act' the characters are currently in and playing with. The 2 acts are the opening and ending acts, i.e. the introduction to boss, and the post-boss fight speeches.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>There are also other functions to hide the dialogue as well as the characters themselves whenever they are not needed on the screen.</p>

                <blockquote class="myQuote">By the way just a side note, if you look at the FileSystem files at the screenshot above, there's an AnimationWaitTest.gd script. and it means exactly what its name states--it's the prototype for this dialogue system. I had to make it first before plunging in this dialogue design, just so I know that it's feasible to be included and function given the limited time. And it did worked. So it's really important to work on your prototypes first before the rest of the things you'd like to add.</blockquote>

                <p>Anyways, back to the functions, the _unhandled_input(_event) method handles the spacebar inputs and continues the animation only when necessary.</p>

                <pre>
    func _unhandled_input(event: InputEvent) -> void:
        if allowed_to_press == true and Global.boss_count == 0:
            if event.is_action_pressed("spacebar"):
                continue_timeline()
                
        if Global.boss_count == 1 and Global.boss_bar.value >= 500:
            if event.is_action_pressed("spacebar"):
                continue_timeline()</pre>

                <p>From what I understand of it, between the _unhandled_input() and _input() methods, the latter is ideally used for controlling a character and alike, while the _unhandled_input() are mostly used for handling controls for the UI, e.g. menu, pause menu, etc., which is why I used it here.</p>

                <img src="../src/img/works/gamedev/kunai_kitten_v0.1.8.2_ss_03.png">

                <p>The mentioned functions also make it more safe and convenient for me to handle the controls with a single button, for as you can see here a Dialogue scene instance is directly a child of the Prototype main scene and they <em>("TestPlayer")</em> share the same spacebar key for inputs.</p>

                <p>Moving on from inputs, and going back to the animation part, it's actually pretty simple: the characters are made of AnimatedSprites and the dialogue panel and texts are composed of a <em>NinePatchRect</em> and a RichTextLabel.</p>

                <img src="../src/img/works/gamedev/kunai_kitten_v0.1.8.2_ss_04.png">

                <ul>
                    <li><b>AnimatedSprites</b> for characters - in this example, the <em>"Protagonist"</em> as I call him here (I haven't decided for a name yet at the time) has different animations with only a single frame each. The AnimationPlayer <em>"Player"</em> can simply choose which non-looping animation, or single frame they would play from the AnimatedSprite Protagonist.</li>
                    <li><b>NinePatchRect</b> for the <em>dialogue panel</em> - to keep the sizes of the edges/borders evenly when being stretched, I used its 9-patch capability.</li>
                    <li><b>RichTextLabel</b> for the texts - good for adding effects. I used the <em>[shake]</em>, <em>[wave]</em>, [rainbow], and <em>[color]</em> tags at certain points.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Aside from these elements, there is also a <em>"ContinueIndicator"</em> Sprite. It's the arrow thing that indicates when the text is visible 100% (I'm sorry I don't know what it's called), and that it's finally okay to accept a spacebar input to continue the timeline. It has its own AnimationPlayer to animate itself <em>hovering</em>.</p>

                <p>The rest of animated values are the modulates, positions, BBCode texts, and the visibility percent of the texts. There is also a <em>"DarkenBG" Panel</em> which is just a simple dark opaque texture to darken the game screen when the dialogue scenes are up. Lastly, a clone of the character without the Area2D, as well as copy of the boss' sprite.</p>

                <p>The 2 are animated in place of the actual characters whenever the actual game scene's process is paused. I pause the main scene Prototype itself when the Dialogue scene is visible in order to pause all process and prevent the input on propagating there, i.e. still shooting bullets when it shouldn't have during Dialogue scenes.</p>

                <p>Overall, that pretty much covers the dialogue system.</p>

                <h1 id="#Kunai Kitten v0.1.8.2 - Super Skill Blitz">Super Skill Blitz</h1>

                <p>Skills and a super are elements that I really would like to try my hands on creating, and so I was stubborn on implementing them for the first time even if it's a jam entry that's very time constrained.</p>

                <p>What I had in mind was very simple: hide the player itself, and just show an animation that depicts their super skill. Of course others have done the same already and I'm just reinventing the wheel, regardless, I'm happy with this thought as for someone who's lacking in experience this is a viable option.</p>

                <img src="../src/img/works/gamedev/kunai_kitten_v0.1.8.2_ss_05.png">

                <p>As you can see here, the <em>"SlashAnimation"</em> is just a <em>Node2D</em> with 3 identical Sprites, as well as the Sprite of the character in a stylized manner. The <em>"Player"</em> AnimationPlayer transforms the 3 <em>"Slash"</em> Sprites' position and scale, so that they would stretch out and form slash motions when played. After transforming the 3 slashes, the Sprite of the player shows up.</p>

                <img src="../src/img/works/gamedev/kunai_kitten_v0.1.8.2_ss_06.png">

                <p>SlashAnimation's Player only plays after accumulating some points by holding the spacebar when eligible for super skill:</p>

                <pre>
    func _process(delta: float) -> void:
        if Input.is_action_pressed("spacebar"):
            if Global.can_blitz == true:
                Global.blitz_charge += delta

                if Global.blitz_charge > 1:
                    Global.camera.zoom = lerp(Global.camera.zoom, Vector2(0.9, 0.9), 0.5)
                    Global.camera.add_trauma(1.0)
                    play("charge")
                    charge.visible = true
                    charge.emitting = true

                if Global.blitz_charge > 2:
                    Global.camera.zoom = lerp(Global.camera.zoom, Vector2(0.85, 0.85), 0.5)

                if Global.blitz_charge > 2.5:
                    Global.camera.zoom = lerp(Global.camera.zoom, Vector2.ONE, 0.5)
                    Global.start_blitz()

        if Input.is_action_just_released("spacebar"):
            charge.visible = false
            charge.emitting = false
            play("idle")</pre>
            
                    <p>While charging for the super skill, the camera also shakes in the process. The dark particles around the player also shows whenever the charge is more than 1.0.</p>

                    <p>Aaaand that's all for the game design and other elements in code! (I think. Well I could've forgotten other things to talk about in this subject :3)</p>

                    <p>There's the impulse, the need and want to create something original, especially when a piece, may it be art or a game in this case, would represent some aspects of your life or yourself. Or you just simply want to create for the process and art of it; that you just want to share something out to the world.</p>

                    <p>By doing so it consumes a lot of time especially in game jam in this case. However, as much as possible, I want my creation (if solo dev) to be mostly made with all of my effort and works. I know I am powerless on my own, but I have enough power to do whatever I can complete--I just need to believe in myself and sacrifice my sleep.</p>

                    <p>And so here we are, I made all the sprites as well as the backgrounds (for good practice, as well as to fight art block and burnout in art). Also I just really want to make something 100% made by me that I'll be proud of, still, I need more practice and study in other fields.</p>

                    <p>It's the same usual workflow I have with sprites. I have a base sprite with their default expression, then I copy it to the next frame to make either another move or facial expression, and repeat the same process as much as I need to.</p>

                    <p>Compared to sprites I'm less experienced to backgrounds, but still I draw and give them a shot in jams.</p>

                    <p>Backgrounds tend to be bigger, of course, as they often fill most of the canvas. Given the limited time, I can only make very simple backgrounds that are enough to fit the ambience I need in a scene.</p>

                    <p>There's no need for so much details when most of time spent on jam games are quite short. If it is a full release outside of jam then you're free to add as much details as you need, even in terms of polishing it.</p>

                    <p>I made a layered mockup in order to know the sizes of the game's sprites and backgrounds. It's important to setup a mockup to get a clear view how you would like the game to look like.</p>

                    <img src="../src/img/works/gamedev/kunai_kitten_v0.1.8.2_ss_09.png">

                    <p>To save more time, I divided the original size into half; from 720x480 to 360x240 canvas. This also makes the pixels more visible when upscaled 2x in-game. The same thing is applied to sprites as relative to the size of the background. Speaking of saving more time, I also just reused most colors in the palette, which can be seen in the background at the bottom.</p>

                    <p>In order to give more life to both backgrounds and <em>remove the flat feel</em>, I used <a href="https://godotshaders.com/shader/god-rays/" target="_blank">a god rays shader made by pend00</a>, as well as emitted some yellow CPUParticles2D.</p>

                    <p>I composed BGM many years ago (I forgot when exactly) and they were not that good as expected. Still, they kinda worked and I'm happy that I applied them on some old games. Despite of it, I haven't really composed anything in these years and so it would only be time consuming to try on producing a decent BGM.</p>

                    <p>The solution for this is for now is surf the net for assets that can be used with their permissible license or author's consent. With that I just went to <a href="https://opengameart.org/" target="_blank">opengameart.org</a> and downloaded musics that I feel that they can resonate with the vibes the game tries to convey. And so I just trusted my feelings when I listened to the BGMs I used here.</p>

                    <p>After these, every menu and screen related to the actual gameplay have their own playing audio in the background. Meaning that they aren't handled by the Global.gd--this also makes it convenient and less confusing when handling multiple musics (at least in my case).</p>

                    <h2 id="#Kunai Kitten v0.1.8.2 - Main Pause">Main Pause</h2>

                    <p>Pausing the main scene, gameplay itself was a nightmare for me. It took me 3 days if I remember correctly on fixing the issue.</p>

                    <p>So the problem with this is that I would like to pause the process of the Prototype main scene, the level scene itself, and continue the process of the Dialogue instance, which is a child of Prototype in this case. I need the parent Prototype's process to pause whenever the dialogue scenes are visible so no inputs will be made, when ideally I want and need the inputs to only work on the dialogue itself.</p>

                    <img src="../src/img/works/gamedev/kunai_kitten_v0.1.8.2_ss_10.png">

                    <p>The solution I have was both Global.gd singleton and Dialogue nodes' <em>pause_mode</em> to be set to <em>PAUSE_MODE_PROCESS</em>, while the parent Prototype is set to PAUSE_MODE_STOP.</p>

                    <p>There wasn't really anything being called in process or physics process within the Dialogue scene and so it's still fine to run even when everything's (or the parent Prototype, in this case) is paused. On the other hand the Prototype scene handles stuff in both its process and physics process so it's necessary to pause when needed to.</p>

                    <p class="divider">‚îà‚îà„Éª‡≠® ‚ú¶ ‡≠ß„Éª‚îà‚îà</p>

                    <h2 id="#Kunai Kitten v0.1.8.2 - Global Persistent Data">Global Persistent Data</h2>

                    <p>The Global.gd script handles all data that is being shared and used across all Scenes, and this includes the value for the player's health, boss bar, score, combo, and even the super skill of the player.</p>

                    <p>There were methods that had conflict with one another, which I'll be honest I completely forgot most of it, but still I managed to fix few problems regarding the health of the player, health of the boss, score, combo, and even the super skill itself. Most of their conflict lies on triggering the scores before and after the boss fight, as transitioning to this part of the game involves toggling the parent Prototype and child Dialogue's process. Furthermore, for some reason, the reset of scores and combo just stopped working whenever you start the Prototype Scene--I just put a bandaid of resetting these values when you go back on the main menu.</p>

                    <p>There is also a problem which I haven't been able to solve: whenever you go super and when its SlashAnimation ended, the process of the parent Prototype should pause. I tried a lot of things which I also forgot by this point and none of them worked. And so I just left it there, waiting to be uncovered by a player who supers at the right moment it reaches enough score to trigger the boss fight right after the animation ended.</p>
                    
                    <pre>
    func start_boss_fight() -> void:
        stage_hide()
        boss_bar.max_value = 500
        boss_bar.value = 0
        dialogue_scene.start()

    func start_dialogue_again() -> void:
        stage_hide()
        dialogue_scene.start()

    func end_dialogue() -> void:
        boss_life = boss_bar.value
        stage_show()

    func stage_hide() -> void:
        player.hide()
        enemy_layer.hide()
        boss_itself.hide()
        ...
        slash_animation.hide()
        slash_animation.player.stop(true)
        get_tree().paused = true

    func stage_show() -> void:
        get_tree().paused = false
        player.show()
        ...
        if boss_count == 1:
            boss_itself.show()

    func start_boss_attack() -> void:
        boss_itself.allow_attack()</pre>

                    <p>Regardless, it was really a headache to deal with and most of the time were spent dealing with these bugs. The good thing is that most things works stable and as intended (for now)--because I haven't given up.</p>

                    <h2 id="#Kunai Kitten v0.1.8.2 - Dialogue Animation">Dialogue Animation</h2>

                    <p>This gave me a heart attack (figuratively speaking). I don't know if it has something to do with changing the interpolation mode of BBCode_text values via AnimationPlayer, but for some reason it really messed up all the values of all keyframes for the BBCode_text.</p>

                    <p>For instance, opening and closing tags of BBCode started appearing when they don't have to.</p>

                    <img src="../src/img/works/gamedev/kunai_kitten_v0.1.8.2_ss_11.png">

                    <p>The fix was to revert its interpolation mode from cubic to linear, and painstakingly adjust all the keyframes.</p>

                    <p>Yes, I could've just undo these actions directly in the Editor, but the thing is that it doesn't allow it. It only reverted some of the actions involving the Nodes and even values on the AnimationPlayer, but not the interpolation mode for some reason. You can undo everything, except this one--I saw a glimpse of hell at that time.</p>

                    <p>Anyways, it was still fixed in a rather acceptable, functioning state so it's good.</p>

                    <p>Overall things have gone well with this short work. It was far from what I originally planned to do, but still I made it work and completed it as well.</p>

                    <p>Even so still I'd like to add the scenes with their partner, as well as more additional dialogue involving the bugs' motivation behind their plotting and actions, and a rather more interesting boss fight. The story on my head would've been more lively and fun to see (as how I see it at least). I was also into making the bugs' behaviour a bit more complex, but it's time consuming as I'm still inexperienced on it, so I ditched the idea and went along with their dull motions.</p>

                    <p>Regardless, this work and jam altogether was a great experience for me. I learned how to work with whatever I have, as well as to work on a feasible scope. I also learned that prototyping before making the assets is really important--it will save you more time and from headache later on, as well as you have a clear understanding (mostly) of what you have to work with, and simply make plans along the way.</p>

                    <p>Another thing that made me happy with the jam are the submissions. I'm happy to see the Godot ecosystem grow this far compared to the very first time I used it. Although I've yet to test more games in the jam since life's been busy, and not all of the submissions work properly on my end.</p>

                    <p>Anyways, it was really fun and stressful, quite an experience as I've said. I made a lot of mistakes, learned from them, and I'm looking forward on making even more mistakes ahead of the road. To learn, of course.</p>

                    <p>Thank you for reading my rather messy thoughts in this devlog. Until next time :3c</p>

                    <h3 id="Artistic; Decline">Artistic; Decline</h3>
                    <p>Over these past months I found myself lost in identity, purpose, and meaning. It was really depressing that I'm just bedrotting each day. My art isn't getting any better, I'm always distracted, and everything felt falling apart. I'm unsatisfied of what I built for myself so far, and art never felt the same--I created content for the sake of content. As much as I want to express myself, when I do, it doesn't really matter and it more like interacting to a wall, really. It felt like I have to be this consistent character, an unmoving figure if you will, just to please everyone according to their tastes--the reason why they followed me in the first place. Having the same type of theme or <em>content</em> makes my art more appealing, more visible to everyone. However I can't, for the sake of my sanity and humanity, my very individual being, I constantly change. Every person does. Everything does. <b>I do change a lot.</b></p>
    
                    <p>Thus I felt stuck with my sanity gradually declining and with this mundane content for the sake of content. Every piece that I post regarding my state, my mental health, or simply expressing how did my day went, goes straight into the void, as no one will ever see and feel them.</p>
    
                    <p>Putting much effort doesn't really guarantee your work's reach and visibility either. Imagine spending days, months, taking enough care for a piece, especially an animation, and it just goes to oblivion. Pieces that I barely care for, made out of spite or boredom with little to no effort and time, tend to get more attention. I hated it. I am not doing art for the sake of views and likes, I'm just tired of having <b>an algorithm decide what is best and what isn't, and what deserves to be shown to everyone</b>. No matter how hard I try to convince myself that these numbers meant nothing, whenever I see something that barely had any effort on it, worse it's a shitpost, I can't help but see mine as a joke for even trying.</p>
    
                    <p>Aside from algorithm and poor <em>interactions</em>, there's this AI problem with every technology, but I'll just focus on social media for the sake of the topic. AI is annoyingly, suffocatingly in every platform that is handled by some major corpo. The amount of pain you have to compete and be cautious for against these hoarding robots is insane. Not only you get your hardwork get stolen for free, these bastards get to profit from it. If you have these all bots in your space, then what is your platform even for? Why even bother put humans in it?</p>
    
                    <p>Feel free to skip this part as this is a rant about this AI problem. Anyways, the thing about AI is that it won't even be a problem if it was built and marketed as <em>a tool to assist humans, especially people who are disabled or who are in need but want to create as much as everyone else, e.g. neurological assistance to put certain graphic tools on screen in action with so much precision, accuracy, and stability</em>, and so much more. But no, they were engineered to steal and print mass copies and content as much as possible with so little time but with so much resources it burns the atmosphere in no time, giving more instability to our climate thus killing thousands of innocent lifeforms who didn't even participated nor know anything about capitalism and economy.</p>

                        Just by training a model, it already has nearly 5x of a lifetime carbon emission from a car, and about 57x to an average human lifespan. It's insane. A lifetime carbon footprint made on a single training in a day, just think about it. We could've released much less footprint if we kept our current activities, computers, without the AI technology. Its resource expense is what making it far more impossible to beat this climate crisis.

                        Regardless of it, I'm aware that there's Nightshade and Glaze to protect my works (even myself) from AI theft, but I just want to post my works straight away without extra steps that also diminish my works' quality. Sharing works doesn't have to be this complex--it must be seamless and simple. Taking this much steps isn't a client-side, user problem, it's an issue from the one who's providing the platform and are visibly, utterly clueless to their consumers. Moreover, just because I'm not a known artist which gets my works less likely to be prompted by others, that doesn't mean I'm completely safe from art theft. I was also paranoid at the time that I started on recording some timelapses just to prove that <em><b>behind this screen was a human who spent countless times making that art</b></em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Adding to all of these was my declining passion in art, may it be the burnout or the lack of interest or both, I'm certain that I no longer find it fun. There's a lot of factors contributing on why such thing happened, and obviously it includes the aforementioned. IRL everyone is chaotic that I can't function, and I'm decaying as an individual so it doesn't help either. I can't connect with everyone, I can't be myself, and I can't even express anything at all. <em><b>Why even live at this point?</b></em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Art was the only thing I was able to regain myself after some trauma. I was able to find myself a purpose, and I was able to give myself a worth. It allowed myself to walk outside again, talk to some people I knew, to some strangers, buy me some food, a warm beverage to drink, a warm comforter to sleep with, new clothes to wear and express myself with, and so much more I started to live as a normal human being again. Eventually I became bad with art, and I meant not only the quality, but the ideas and motivation behind it. This was the only thing that gave me purpose and meaning, and without it, <em><b>then what am I</b></em>? The need and act for art was necessary for me to function, but then it was making me suffer that I cannot do anything at all. Regardless of my physical health, if I'm still mentally unwell I won't be able to move forward.

It's not worth fighting or struggling for. I'm just exhausted of the cycle and I want to rest from this. I rather focus on my mental health and well-being than be another braindead consumer that fuels these corporations who doesn't give an ounce of fuck to their users because they have nothing to lose.

                        The internet felt so bland and fake, and it's because of everything being simplified in design, limiting features for its users (notably customizations), AI-generated content, and media that are no longer a form of expression but are made to gather numbers and advertisements. Even with all of these, creative web is not dead, and we can fight for it by supporting pro-creator sites like BlueSky, Cara.app, Mastodon, and websites in Neocities and Nekoweb.

                        I started revisiting my interests in old web, emulation, obscure media and tech, and coding in general, and it was really refreshing to me. The once long gone pieces that constitutes my entire being were recovered--I felt as myself again, reinvigorated, reanimated even. I am alive seeing these footages of grown pieces of hardware, software, and media. I might have not been part of most of them due to the gaps in years when I was spawned into reality, but I do still adore their very own existence. Thankful and glad that these objects who have nothing to do with me were existing in their prime at some point, with more relevance, and was able to make a mark in history, and even to this day still amazes people like me.

                        Admittedly, I am not knowledgeable when it comes to the technical details to a machine's anatomy, nevertheless I have this mild obsession and interest with them. I do want to make some time for hardware in the future, but that comes after securing stability in other aspects of my life, I can only do few things at the moment just so as to stay alive and sane. Anyways, continuing to the topic, to think that these things that are much older than me, stays relevant and builds awesome communities that supports them to the point that they still work to the modern internet is beyond amazing and just tells a lot on how people care about preservation and history of our technology.

                        This part is a rant so feel free to skip it. Corporations don't give a fuck and would cut the life out of these systems as long as their competitors sell something new in the market, not even preservation is in their dictionary. After all, it is a race whose technology is the latest, and best in presentation even. True, there are some exceptions in some forms that preserves them, for instance N*ntendo has their own museum for their creations in the past, but that doesn't necessarily mean they continue the production of these titles and other owned IPs for there are more things the newer technology could present to the mass consumers, and so they will go for the obvious route. They may have brought older medias back thru their own emulations but they as slow and unoptimized as they can get to their own hardware. Not to mention that they are in digital format, not in physical media, which is worse. Adding to this is they are glad to shut down countless emulators and ROM/hacking sites that do much better job at preserving their media, when these community projects had no any visibly negative effect nor impact on their profits given their large number of loyal consumers.

                        Going back to the main topic of this section, which was about the old web, obscure media and tech, and anything between these, it's cool to see that they are alive to this day, and fully functional to some degree even. I'm not really a fan of much slimmer devices nowadays, as aside from being usually bland in design, in durability they tend to be fragile. Well they're convenient to fit in a lot of spaces so I'll give them that, but bulkier devices are more hot and has more personality with them--obviously they tend to be more durable too.

                        While the modern devices, for instance the Andri*d smartphones, comes in lots of flavors, it doesn't hold a candle compared to the variations available in the past--the designs and applications are absurd, the creativity was skyrocketing like bananas. There's a huge range when it comes to the layout of the buttons and screens, shape and size, and the number of peripherals and accessories they can handle. It revolutionized the trends and the internet culture even to this day.

                        I grew up with an original PSP with UMD support and a bootleg GBA SP which games, if I recall correctly, contains flashed "160000" ROMs. Insane right? I was oblivious at the time on why the Gameboy was painfully slow at boot and at certain times, and why it has this library of unnecessary copies of the same group of games. Young me was trying to complete Crash Bandicoot XS and N-Tranced with all that gems and time attacks, but I never did. There's also Digimon Battle Spirit 2, Egg Mania, Kurukuru Kururin, a robot-building/fighting game, and a LOTR turn-based RPG, games that I spent hours only to not really beat them.

                        Our chunky old PC came with Windows XP installed, and bundled with Virtua Cop 2, Bejeweled 2, Zuma Deluxe, Need for Speed Underground 2, and some Game House Collection. By some, unfortunately not all games can run in our PC. In weekends, we'll go to our cousin and play with their PC, notably because they are connected to the internet. Cartoon Network, Y8, and Friv were our favorite spots in the web, and I'm not sure whether we played Kizi at the time, but I do remember visiting their site too at the time.

                        Of course we didn't only spent our time with games, as quite diligent pupils we were once, we also tend to open and browse this cool program by Microsoft called Encarta Kids 2008, and I'm telling you that this is one of the only things I like about that company aside from Windows XP and 7, and yes, even their (formerly) Nokia Lumia.

                        As much as I hated being in school and taking their boring curriculum, the learning materials through from these programs didn't bored me to death at all! I really felt like a student than a capitalist slave trainee for the future. Dinosaurs, human anatomy, origin of halloween, various art movements, history of film, parts of a bicycle, animal behaviours and habitats, everything's in it! Well almost everything to be exact, and it was outdated when it comes to information as again, we had no internet connection at the time. Not to mention they also come with a dictionary and a rather advanced scientific calculator which came pretty handy.

                        Aside from all of these, we also used to play our PSP 3000 a lot. Our game library has Lego Batman (iirc the name), Bliss Island, Ben 10 Protector of Earth, Dragon Ball Z Shin Budokai Another Road, and Invizimals: Shadow Zone, my <em>bias</em> from all of them.

                        The game really captured me when I saw the clean, glossy and vibrant renders of the monsters on the UMD cover. I was entranced with the in-game visuals and UI, the visual and sound design (particularly with the Invizimals Catalog), and most importantly, the 3d models of the Invizimals. There is so much data for my brain to input into a messy information soup. God this game was a blessing especially considering the limitations of hardware at the time, the team behind it managed to push its limits, and take advantage of the AR technology. I was really bummed out when no one in our area knows what Invizimals is, as you would've guessed, Pokemon took over the world. Don't get me wrong, I love Pokemon too and mostly around the GBA releases (and currently adding the MOBA Pokemon UNITE), but it would be awesome to have Invizimals to be as relevant, popular, and one of its competitors in the genre and market. Anyways that's all for now about Invizimals, Shadow Zone specifically, as I'll save more details for the shrine. Overall, I love Invizimals and I'd like to see what it could have been in these days.

                    <p>
                        Given with the absurd prices of the hardware, I decided to not invest yet to them considering the necessities I need to live everyday. So in order to have new experiences with these relics, I have the emulation on my side. With it I also got to try other titles that I've never been into before. I get to read more information about these games on their wikis, forums, and even in the social media that I never got to bother doing back then. Due to circumstances, I no longer possess my original copies of my games, and so emulation is the solution I decided to go with, plus, it works even better on my hardware performance-wise (minus the lack of peripherals or intended controllers/accessories). With it and these amazing communities that keep these titles alive, my connection on the games lives to this day.

                        This is a momentarily end of reminiscing the good things we had in the past. It doesn't necessarily mean that I have to let go of them just to move forward when I can walk with them in the process. Discarding them meant the gradual disappearance of what I am as today. I don't like the old things because I want to live with those times and be myself in the past, rather, I want to walk alongside with them into the future with who I am today and will ever be.

It was a pain to setup due to display and audio driver issues, as well as boot up problems, but after several attempts of reviving my laptop I managed to make it stable and fully functional as intended. Unlike from my previous attempts, this I would say the <em>'final stable'</em> installation I have so far. I'll write a separate blog on the horrors I encountered when dealing with this OS, anyways, moving on.

I really hated the Steam release due to how unusable it is even with the compatibility layer it offers. As much as I needed to switch my setup, I still want to hold on with my laptop and get the most out of it given the limitations--I want to preserve it. I'll assemble a new setup sooner or later as I need to renovate my workspace.

                        Speaking of software, my Aseprite works well, and I got both stable VSCodium and Librewolf which works blazingly fast, which could imply that I <em>properly</em> partitioned my SSD this time. Given these, I'm pretty much glad with my current setup--Mint is clean, simple, and customizable to an extent (I'm using XFCE).

                        Tech stuff aside, I also managed to track my habits, to-do's, and moods. Albeit I haven't tracked my sleeping behavior yet. My thoughts about it is that it's kinda neat to have this database you can peek into and see notes of what you did and feeling on that day. You get to reflect at some points, and probably be able to make better decisions at the present. Anyways, I'm taking care of myself, and that's a huge step for me--I was able to see my worth beyond art, beyond my body, beyond the numbers I'm making online and in reality. That's why I'm really thankful to these software (although it would be cool for the DailyBean to work offline), I'm able to record my progress. You see, my brain cannot retain too much information, not even crystal clear, regarding my experiences, as I got used to repressing my emotions and memories from the past (this would be a topic to a different time), so these apps really saved me on keeping a journal.

                        I'd like to get back on my journal and blog entries someday, look back at my writings from my experiences, and laugh at it. Think about how far I've come. How it was this simple all this time. That I'm still learning a lot of things despite of my age. That I'm perfect as being the imperfect being I am. That I grew. That I became a proper adult. That I managed to live a fulfilling life to the end. That I'll be satisfied even after death. That this is the Din that once lived to this generation, era, and the very fabric of reality.

                        If you're reading this 20 years from now, Din, I just have a question for you.

                        I know that you can do it. Keep coming up whenever you see yourself down in the mud. Keep moving on under the heavy rains. No strong winds will ever send you away far from these lands. Just keep on getting up.

                        Alright, that's enough for the cringe bits. Regardless of the journals and habit tracking apps, it won't do anything if I don't do my part. Being depressed and miserable is okay, but staying as is isn't. If I want changes to happen I have to start from myself, I'm the one that will make things possible and happen. This is the sole purpose of my webpages and partaking in the web revival movement.

                        Everything starts now.

                        I'm going to be actively working on both art and web dev, and eventually be back on game dev as well. That's how I'd like to live my life starting this day. It would be a tough road as there's a lot of obstacles in the way, but those won't matter.

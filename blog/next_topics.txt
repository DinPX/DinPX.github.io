As far as I can remember, I learned how to draw when I was around 4 years old, and my first artwork was that mask of Spider-Man,
drawn with a blue gel pen on a writing notebook. Then I drew a house with a yellow sun on the right corner with the use of crayons.

At the time I knew what I'd like to be growing up: a doctor.
